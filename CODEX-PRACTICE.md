## SHEET 0 · HOW TO HANDLE THIS THING

- Treat each sheet as **modular**. You can:
  - Print selected pages.
  - Rearrange the stack.
  - Annotate, tape over, or delete entire chunks.
- Let it **age**:
  - Add dates when you revise a section.
  - Let some pages go out of date on purpose.
- Use it in **short bursts**:
  - Before a project starts.
  - When something breaks.
  - At the end of a season or cycle.

**Marking system (clip this legend to the first divider)**

- `▢` = something you can try today.
- `✂︎ TEAR LINE` = you are invited to literally cut, tear, or remove.
- `[   ]` = space for your own additions / contradictions.
- `◎` = mark with a circle when off-screen work is required. Drop a link to the resource you’ll check before leaving the desk: `[________](_____________________)`.

✂︎ **TEAR LINE** — Cut below to make a quick reference bookmark for the legend.

## SHEET 1 · MICRO–COLLAPSE PROTOCOL (SOFT FAILURE KIT)

Use when you’re about to try something risky but important.

1. **Name the container**
   Write: _“If this fails, it only breaks: __________________.”_
   - Keep the circle small: one afternoon, one prototype, one scene.

2. **Set a soft floor**
   ▢ Define what must **not** be harmed:
   - People’s safety: `__________________________________`
   - Relationships: `__________________________________`
   - Minimum resources: `__________________________________`

3. **Run the attempt**
   Let it wobble. Note any signs of strain in the system.

4. **Gentle autopsy (15 minutes max)**
   - What bent?
   - What held?
   - What surprised you?

   Write one sentence for each, then stop. No spiral, no self-trial.

✂︎ **TEAR LINE** — Tag the debris: _“This failed softly on (date) ______. It taught me: ______________________.”_

### Project Pulse (Cross-check)

- ▢ `[Project Slot A]` — Soft floor updated after each run? Reference: `[Link](__________________)`.
- ▢ `[Project Slot B]` — List the one subsystem you can let fail per session.
- ▢ `[Project Slot C]` — Before firmware / publishing / shipping, confirm the soft floor includes **safety**.
- ▢ `[Project Slot D]` — After each build push, run a 5-minute gentle autopsy and staple the strip to the log.

◎ When any box is checked, read the matching off-screen cue: `[Season / Body resource](__________________)`.

## SHEET 2 · FAILURE QUOTA LEDGER

Failure is not an exception; it’s a quota you’re allowed to meet.

1. Set a **small quota** for a project cycle (week / month / season):
   - “I will collect **___ soft failures** by: _______________ [date].”

2. Each time something fails without harming your soft floor:
   - ▢ Log it in three lines (duplicable strip):
     1. What I tried: `_________________________`
     2. What failed (mechanically): `____________`
     3. What was still intact (systemically): `___`

3. When the quota is reached:
   - Take 20 minutes to scan the three logs.
   - Circle anything that feels like a **pattern**.
   - Decide: “I retire this pattern” or “I lean into this pattern.”

4. Optional ritual:
   Burn / shred / crumple the logs and keep only a **one-line summary** of the pattern.

> Soft failure is rehearsal for risk. The goal is not avoiding collapse, but making collapse survivable and legible.

### Project Hooks

| Project | Quota Label | Most recent pattern date |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `____________________` | `____________________` | `____________` |
| `____________________` | `____________________` | `____________` |
| `____________________` | `____________________` | `____________` |
| `____________________` | `____________________` | `____________` |

◎ If the pattern involves fatigue, schedule a body/space reset. Link your cue here: `[________________](________________)`.

✂︎ **TEAR LINE** — Cut out the table to tape onto the current project spread.

## SHEET 3 · PERMISSIONS TO FORGET

Forgetting is not always neglect; sometimes it is pruning.

### License to Forget (carryable card)

Cut this out. Put it in your notebook or wallet.

> **LICENSE TO FORGET**
> Holder: `_______________________`
>
> You have standing permission to forget:
> - Projects that no longer match your values.
> - Metrics that were inherited, not chosen.
> - Roles you were drafted into instead of accepting.
>
> Conditions:
> - You honor any people who would be harmed by this forgetting.
> - You write down, once, why you are setting it down.
>
> Signature: `________________`   Date: `___________`

✂︎ **TEAR LINE** — After using this once, tear the card in half and make a new one with different conditions.

### The Compost Page

1. Reserve a spread titled **COMPOST**.
2. Whenever a project, concept, or plan feels heavy but unfinished:
   - ▢ Move it to COMPOST with a date and a one-sentence note:
     - “I’m letting this rot because: ___________________.”
3. Every season:
   - Read only the **oldest** 3–5 entries.
   - Ask:
     - Is there a nutrient here? (method, phrase, contact, pattern)
     - Or is this just mass?
4. Pull out at most **one** nutrient per item.
   Rewrite it somewhere active.
   Cross out the original COMPOST entry with a single line.

◎ For anything moved to compost, walk away from screens. Point yourself to an off-screen task: `[yard / plant / weather cue](________________)`.

## SHEET 4 · WORKING DEFINITIONS (REVISION-READY)

These are not universal. They are provisional, local to you. Overwrite them when they stop serving.

### System

> A system is a pattern of relationships that keeps making more of itself.

- It is not just components; it is **flows**: attention, power, resources, signals.
- Systems can be tiny (a morning routine) or sprawling (an educational apparatus).
- A system is what keeps happening even when no one intends it anymore.

▢ **Field test:** Choose a project you’re inside. List:
- Elements: `________________`
- Flows: `________________`
- Friction: `________________`
- Evidence: `________________`

### Glitch

> A glitch is the system telling on itself.

- Not a bug to swat— a diagnostic flare.
- ▢ When you spot one, trace the dependency web. Circle the node you are willing to stress test.

### Repair

> Repair is a promise made with your hands.

- It must leave the system more legible than before.
- ▢ Before you repair, annotate what story you are preserving.

### Joy

> Joy is feedback from a system worth keeping.

- It feels like spaciousness, not adrenaline.
- ▢ When joy shows up, log it with time, place, people, and conditions. Protect those conditions.

✂︎ **TEAR LINE** — Use the strips as glossary inserts elsewhere in the notebook.

## SHEET 5 · NEW SEASONAL LOGICS & FIELD CHECKS

Rain / Wind / Long Shadow as pacing tools bigger than a to-do list.

### Rain (Burst Work)

- `▢` Identify one burst task that feeds each active project.
- `▢` Cross-check with your interlude/spore list.
- `◎` Pair each burst with a body reset. Link the cue: `[________](________________)`.

### Wind (Circulation)

- `▢` Schedule how each project shares signals (demo, feedback, documentation).
- `▢` Confirm one outward flow is non-digital (mail art, bench visit, yard check).
- `◎` Consult your seasonal README or care guide before leaving the studio: `[________](________________)`.

### Long Shadow (Consequence)

- `▢` For each project, write the consequence if you stop now vs. continue for another season.
- `▢` Note any relationships or ecosystems impacted. Circle the ones needing a conversation.
- `◎` Sync with the relevant seasonal cue sheet: `[________](________________)`.

### Field Checks Grid

| Week | Rain Target | Wind Route | Long Shadow Note | Evidence Collected |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `________________` | `________________` | `________________` | `____________` |
| 2 | `________________` | `________________` | `________________` | `____________` |
| 3 | `________________` | `________________` | `________________` | `____________` |
| 4 | `________________` | `________________` | `________________` | `____________` |

✂︎ **TEAR LINE** — Tape this grid to the inside back cover of your sketchbook for quick scanning.

## SHEET 6 · RITUALS OF DECAY & REMAKING

Formalized ways to mark that you’ve changed.

### Scheduled Rot

- `▢` Pick a page per month to wound on purpose (tear, blackout, burn the edge safely).
- `▢` Annotate why the wound matters.
- `◎` After wounding, grab one tactile task before you archive the feeling: `[________](________________)`.

### Contradiction Index

- Maintain a list of tensions you agree not to ignore.

| Contradiction | First noticed | Status | Next review |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `__________________________________` | `____` | `holding / spiking / resolved` | `____` |
| `__________________________________` | `____` | `holding / spiking / resolved` | `____` |

- `▢` When a contradiction spikes, flag the related project.
- `▢` Decide whether to absorb, broadcast, or re-engineer.

### Remaking Cue

- `▢` After a contradiction review, write a tiny manifesto (3 lines) about what the system is now.
- `▢` Pin it next to the relevant hardware or print stack.

## SHEET 8 · VERSION FOOTER & DEBRIEF

Where this copy’s life is tracked: what version, revised after which failure/season/conversation/glitch.

| Version | Date | Trigger (failure / season / convo / glitch) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `________` | `________` | `_________________________` | `________________________________` |
| `________` | `________` | `_________________________` | `________________________________` |
| `________` | `________` | `_________________________` | `________________________________` |

### Debrief Prompts (use after each revision)

- What practice died this round? `________________________________________`
- What new ritual came alive? `___________________________________________`
- What project will get the next sheet you print? `________________________`

◎ Before you close the codex, do one cue from your off-screen care list: `[________](________________)`.

---

### Sideways Modules (Edges of the Codex)

**Embodied Knowing (Off-Screen Practice)**
- Keeps the body in the room: routes, posture, micro-walks, and small physical adjustments as systems work.
- `▢` Cross-reference whatever rhythm doc keeps you honest: `[________](________________)`.

**Anti-README / Anti-Instruction**
- Protects a wild zone where some pieces exist without being explained.
- Exercises in not prefacing everything, and in letting one work per season travel without text.

**Weather Report (Inner Weather)**
- A way to log mood and pressure as weather, not as defects.
- Weekly Sky/Wind/Pressure notes, plus small experiments linking inner weather back to the systems that shape it.

> Rip pages. Tape sound samples. Glue dried leaves. Make the codex a living accomplice, not a pamphlet.
