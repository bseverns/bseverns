## 0 · HOW TO USE THIS CODEX

- Treat each section as **modular**. You can:
  - Print selected pages.
  - Rearrange them.
  - Annotate, tape over, or delete entire chunks.
- Let it **age**:
  - Add dates when you revise a section.
  - Let some pages go out of date on purpose.
- Use it in **short bursts**:
  - Before a project starts.
  - When something breaks.
  - At the end of a season or cycle.

**Marking system**

- `▢` = something you can try today.  
- `✂︎ TEAR LINE` = a place where you are invited to literally cut, tear, or remove.  
- `[   ]` = space for your own additions / contradictions.

## 1 · PRACTICES FOR SOFT FAILURE

Soft failure is a way to fall without pretending you didn’t,  
and without shattering the whole system.

### 1.1 · Micro–Collapse Protocol

Use when you’re about to try something risky but important.

1. **Name the container**  
   Write: _“If this fails, it only breaks: ________.”_  
   - Keep the circle small: one afternoon, one prototype, one scene.

2. **Set a soft floor**  
   ▢ Define what must **not** be harmed:
   - People’s safety: `_________________________________`
   - Relationships: `__________________________________`
   - Minimum resources: `____What is needed to distract from cell phone and be here?_______`

3. **Run the attempt**  
   Let it wobble. Note any signs of strain in the system.

4. **Gentle autopsy (15 minutes max)**  
   - What bent?  
   - What held?  
   - What surprised you?  

   Write one sentence for each, then stop. No spiral, no self-trial.

✂︎ **TEAR LINE**  
Tear this strip off after the autopsy and staple it to whatever you broke, as a tag:  
_“This failed softly on (date) ______. It taught me: ______________________.”_

### 1.2 · The Failure Quota

Failure is not an exception; it’s a quota you’re allowed to meet.

1. Set a **small quota** for a project cycle (week / month / season):  
   - “I will collect **3 soft failures** by: _______________ [date].”

2. Each time something fails without harming your soft floor:
   - ▢ Log it in three lines:
     1. What I tried: `_________________________`
     2. What failed (mechanically): `____________`
     3. What was still intact (systemically): `___`

3. When the quota is reached:
   - Take 20 minutes to scan the three logs.
   - Circle anything that feels like a **pattern**.
   - Decide: “I retire this pattern” or “I lean into this pattern.”

4. Optional ritual:  
   Burn / shred / crumple the logs and keep only a **one-line summary** of the pattern.

> Soft failure is rehearsal for risk.  
> The goal is not avoiding collapse, but making collapse survivable and legible.

## 2 · PERMISSIONS TO FORGET

Forgetting is not always neglect; sometimes it is pruning.

### 2.1 · License to Forget (carryable card)

Cut this out. Put it in your notebook or wallet.

> **LICENSE TO FORGET**  
> Holder: `_______________________`  
>  
> You have standing permission to forget:
> - Projects that no longer match your values.  
> - Metrics that were inherited, not chosen.  
> - Roles you were drafted into instead of accepting.  
>  
> Conditions:
> - You honor any people who would be harmed by this forgetting.  
> - You write down, once, why you are setting it down.  
>  
> Signature: `________________`   Date: `___________`

✂︎ **TEAR LINE**  
After using this once, you may tear the card in half and make a new one with different conditions.

### 2.2 · The Compost Pile

Not every idea needs archiving; some need decomposition.

1. Reserve a page (or folder) titled **COMPOST**.  
2. Whenever a project, concept, or plan feels heavy but unfinished:
   - ▢ Move it to COMPOST with a date and a one-sentence note:
     - “I’m letting this rot because: ___________________.”

3. Every season:
   - Read only the **oldest** 3–5 entries.
   - Ask:
     - Is there a nutrient here? (a method, phrase, contact, pattern)
     - Or is this just mass?

4. Pull out at most **one** nutrient per item.  
   Rewrite it somewhere active.  
   Cross out the original COMPOST entry with a single line.

> The point is not to keep everything.  
> The point is to let some things return to soil.

## 3 · WORKING DEFINITIONS (REVISION-READY)

These are not universal. They are provisional, local to you.  
You are invited to overwrite them.

### 3.1 · System

> A system is a pattern of relationships that keeps making more of itself.

- It is not just components; it is **flows**: attention, power, resources, signals.
- Systems can be tiny (a morning routine) or sprawling (an educational apparatus).
- A system is what keeps happening even when no one intends it anymore.

▢ **Field test:**  
Choose a project you’re inside.  
List:
- Elements: `people, tools, places, rules`
- Flows: `who moves what to whom, and when`

Then ask: _“What keeps this pattern going when I’m tired?”_  
That’s the system.

**SYSTEM, YOUR VERSION**

`SYSTEM, YOUR VERSION: _________________________________________________`

`______________________________________________________________________`

`______________________________________________________________________`

### 3.2 · Glitch

> A glitch is a visible misalignment that reveals how the system actually works.

- Glitches are not just errors; they are **moments of truth**.
- They show hidden assumptions, default settings, power lines.

▢ **Field test:**  
Next time something “just doesn’t work,” instead of smoothing it over, ask:
- Who is this broken for?
- Who is it still working for?
- What assumption failed?

Record one sentence and call it a **glitch note**.

### 3.3 · Repair

> Repair is any act that changes a system so that more beings can continue with less harm.

- Not all repairs return things to their previous state.
- Some repairs are **subtractive**: removing a harmful rule.
- Some repairs are **redistributive**: moving load from one person to many.

▢ **Field test:**  
Before you “fix” something, note:
- _“Who benefits from the current brokenness?”_  
- _“Who benefits from my proposed repair?”_  

If the answers are the same, consider whether you’re patching, not repairing.

### 3.4 · Contradiction

> A contradiction is when two truths, both real, cannot both win under the current rules.

- Example: “Everyone is welcome” vs. “We only meet at 7am across town.”
- Contradictions often live in schedules, budgets, and building layouts.

▢ **Field test:**  
Write one contradiction you’re carrying:

> _I am trying to be both `__________` and `__________` in a system that only rewards `__________`._

Contradictions don’t always resolve; sometimes they just become more explicit and shared.

### 3.5 · Joy

> Joy is the sensation of being briefly in right relation—with yourself, with others, with the work, with the world.

- Not constant happiness. Not productivity.
- Often small, often quiet, often shared.

▢ **Field test:**  
At the end of a day, ask:
- “Where did I feel a small spark of aliveness that wasn’t extractive?”  

Write one line. Protect that condition.

## 4 · NEW SEASONAL LOGICS

These logics are ways of pacing work across cycles larger than a to-do list.

### 4.1 · Rain Logic

Rain doesn’t schedule itself; it arrives in bursts, saturates, then drains.

Use Rain Logic when:
- You’re in a period of many ideas, limited time.
- You need to soak a field, not water each leaf.

**Principles**

- Accept **clusters**: work in intense, time-boxed showers.
- Let water **pool**: don’t immediately resolve everything.

▢ **Practice: The Downpour Session**

1. Set a 60–90 minute window: “Rain is allowed here.”
2. In that time:
   - Start as many small moves as you can (sketches, notes, emails, prototypes).
   - Do not finish them.
3. At the end:
   - Circle 1–2 things that feel like puddles worth returning to.
   - Everything else: let evaporate unless they reappear later.

Write:  
“Rain day on ________. What remained in the puddles: ______________.”

### 4.2 · Wind Logic

Wind moves through spaces, invisible but traceable by what it touches.

Use Wind Logic when:
- You need circulation: ideas stuck in one room, file, group.
- You want cross-pollination without heavy structure.

**Principles**

- Move **light** and often: share drafts, half-finished objects.
- Accept drift: not everything lands where you intend.

▢ **Practice: The Draft Drift**

1. Pick one unfinished thing.  
2. Send or show it to **one person** with a simple prompt:
   - “Notice anything?” or “Where does this want to go?”
3. Note their response; do not defend the work.  
4. Decide:
   - Push it further,  
   - Let it continue drifting,  
   - Or let it leave your hands entirely.

Wind logic honors the path work takes after it leaves you.

### 4.3 · Long Shadow Logic

When the sun is low, every object throws a long shadow.  
Long Shadow logic is about consequences stretched across years.

Use it when:
- You’re making choices that will outlive a semester, a grant cycle, a job.

**Principles**

- Ask not only “What do we do now?” but “What becomes easier / harder later because of this?”
- Cast a **shadow sketch** for major decisions.

▢ **Practice: Shadow Sketch**

For a decision you’re facing, draw three lines:

- 3 months from now: `_____________________`
- 3 years from now: `______________________`
- 13 years from now: `_____________________`

Who is standing in these shadows?  
What do they inherit from your choice—tools, stories, debt, warmth?

✂︎ **TEAR LINE**  
Tear off your shadow sketch and tape it where you’ll see it again.  
Revisit it when one of those dates arrives.

## 5 · RITUALS OF DECAY & REMAKING

This codex should not remain pristine. It should show its use.

### 5.1 · Scheduled Rot

Pick a repeating date (first day of each new season, or a solstice, or your birthday).

On that day:

▢ **1. Select pages to wound**  
   - Choose at least one page that no longer feels right.
   - Circle any sentence that makes you wince.

▢ **2. Mark decay**  
   - Cross out what no longer holds.  
   - Write in the margin:  
     - “This belonged to a past version of me who needed: _______.”

▢ **3. Destroy something small**  
   - Tear off a corner, erase a diagram, remove a definition.
   - Optional: compost, burn, recycle the torn piece.

▢ **4. Add a replacement seed**  
   - On the next blank space, write one new sentence, practice, or question.

> Decay is not a bug in your practice; it’s the only evidence it’s alive.

### 5.2 · The Contradiction Index

Keep a running list of tensions that refuse to resolve.

1. Title a page: **CONTRADICTION INDEX**.  
2. Each time you meet a core contradiction:
   - Write it as a short, sharp line:
     - “We say we center kids; we center schedules.”
3. Once a month:
   - Pick one contradiction and ask:
     - Can this be **designed around**?  
     - Must this be **named and held**?  
     - Or does this require a **change of system**, not a change of habit?

You do not have to solve the Index.  
You just have to stop pretending it isn’t there.

## 6 · BLANK MODULE TEMPLATE (FOR YOUR FUTURE SECTIONS)

Use this when you invent new logics, rituals, or practices.

### [Module Title Here]

**Why this exists**  
_One sentence: what hurt, gap, or desire is this responding to?_

**When to use it**  
- `___________`  
- `___________`  

**Practice**  
▢ Step 1: `__________________________`  
▢ Step 2: `__________________________`  
▢ Step 3: `__________________________`  

**Aftercare / Reflection**  
- What did this shift?  
- What did this reveal?  

✂︎ **TEAR LINE**  
_Instructions for how this module may be torn, retired, or rewritten._

## 7 · VERSION FOOTER

When you next revise this codex:

- Change the version tag on the front.
- Date the revision here:

> v________ made on `__________` after:  
> - a failure  
> - a season change  
> - a conversation  
> - a glitch worth keeping

You are not obligated to keep any of this.  
You are invited to keep **just enough** to make the next version more honest.
