# PROJECT CARD · HOME PRINTLAB SETUP
*Space / infrastructure / making room to make*

> The lab is a tool, not a shrine. Make it kind, usable, and real.

---

## 0 · Intent (why this exists)

- **Primary intent:** Turn the home print space into a safe, usable tool ecosystem.
- **Secondary intent:** Document the workflow so it can be taught, repeated, and improved.
- **Soft floor:** Safety, ventilation, and shared living space come first.

## 1 · What “done” means (for this season)

These are **targets**, not history. The machine-docs repo is the source of truth for the current lab layout and inventory.

- Core machines reliably powered and printing.
- At least one end-to-end workflow documented (software/tooling names may change).
- Space feels inviting, not perpetually “under construction.”

## 2 · How to work (teachable loop)

1. **Clear a path**
   - One complete tool chain with no detours.
   - **Lab layout + machine inventory (source of truth):**  
     https://github.com/bseverns/machine-docs/tree/main/personal-machines
2. **Document the friction**
   - Every snag gets a note and a fix attempt.
3. **Teach it back**
   - If you can’t teach the workflow in 5 minutes, it’s not done.

## 3 · Current anchors

- **Season dashboard:** [seasonDASH.md](seasonDASH.md)
- **Winter field kit:** [WINTER-FIELD-KIT.md](WINTER-FIELD-KIT.md)
- **Plant/seasonal care:** [plant-seasonal-care/README.md](plant-seasonal-care/README.md)

## 4 · Tiny next moves

- [ ] Clear one complete tool path (slicing station → printer).
- [ ] Label 3 high-friction drawers/boxes with what they *actually* hold.
- [ ] Run one full “idea → print” and log every snag.

## 5 · Notes to future me (teaching cues)

- Teach the workflow like you’re onboarding a friend at midnight.
- The lab should invite use, not guilt.
- If a tool is a pain to reach, it’s a pain to learn.

**Status:** building the floor before hanging the art.
