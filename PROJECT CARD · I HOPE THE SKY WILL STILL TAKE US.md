# PROJECT CARD · I HOPE THE SKY WILL STILL TAKE US
*Album / drone-noise / surveillance-skies lament*

> Loud weather, slow burn. This is a record about looking up and not trusting what looks back.

## 0 · Intent (why this exists)

- **Primary intent:** Make a body of sound that treats surveillance, longing, and the sky as one tangled system.
- **Secondary intent:** Build a repeatable texture practice you can teach to someone else without the mystique.
- **Soft floor:** Protect hearing, sleep, and core obligations. This is a season, not a sentence.

## 1 · What “done” means (for this season)

These are **targets**, not history. The live-rig notes are the source of truth for the actual setup, sessions, and scope.

- A small core of named spine tracks (count can flex).
- A raw capture bank large enough to teach the texture method.
- One interlude that ships without explanation.

## 2 · How to work (teachable loop)

1. **Field capture**
   - Minimum rig: *any* recorder + one constraint.
   - Constraints are punk: one location, one mic position, one time window.
   - **Implementation notes / current rig truth:**  
     https://github.com/bseverns/live-rig/tree/main/ep-i-hope-the-sky-will-still-take-us
2. **Listening day**
   - No edits. Just annotate with tags: `Sky / Wind / Pressure`.
3. **Cut day**
   - Select only what survived the listening day.
4. **Reflection**
   - Log: what the system wanted, what you refused.

## 3 · Current anchors

- **Season dashboard:** [seasonDASH.md](seasonDASH.md)
- **Winter field kit:** [WINTER-FIELD-KIT.md](WINTER-FIELD-KIT.md)
- **Codex reference:** [workP.md](workP.md)

## 4 · Tiny next moves

- [ ] Record 10+ minutes of one “still sky” texture (no edits).
- [ ] Write 3 weather tags for existing sketches.
- [ ] Do a 10-minute listen-only pass and log one refusal.

## 5 · Notes to future me (teaching cues)

- If you can’t explain the rig in three sentences, it’s too precious.
- Beauty is not the enemy. The *frame* is the enemy.
- Document the choices so someone else can remix the method.

**Status:** alive, experimental, low-drama.
