# PROJECT CARD · MN42 (MOARkNOBS-42)
*Open, legible, critical MIDI controller (hardware + firmware)*

> Build the knobs, show the guts, teach the method. No black boxes.

---

## 0 · Intent (why this exists)

- **Primary intent:** A controller that can be audited, rebuilt, and misused on purpose.
- **Secondary intent:** A teaching artifact for open hardware: how to design, document, and de-mystify.
- **Soft floor:** No heroic sprints. Safety > speed > shine.

## 1 · What “done” means (for this season)

These are **targets**, not history. The MN42 HISTORY + CHANGELOG are the source of truth for what actually shipped or shifted.

- Hardware decisions in a stable, documented state (panel, IO, connectors).
- Firmware in a teachable state (core modes stable, not every dream).
- One honest build + usage guide, even if it’s ugly.

## 2 · How to work (teachable loop)

1. **Prototype in containers**
   - Each rev gets a box: date, goals, risks, notes.
2. **One decision per session**
   - Panel OR IO OR firmware pathway. Don’t mush.
3. **Public-facing note**
   - Every session ends with 3 bullets: what changed, why, what broke.

## 3 · Current anchors

- **Season dashboard:** [seasonDASH.md](seasonDASH.md)
- **Codex reference:** [workP.md](workP.md)
- **Winter field kit:** [WINTER-FIELD-KIT.md](WINTER-FIELD-KIT.md)
- **Core docs (source of truth):**  
  - https://github.com/bseverns/MOARkNOBS-42/blob/main/docs/HISTORY.md  
  - https://github.com/bseverns/MOARkNOBS-42/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md

## 4 · Tiny next moves

- [ ] Mark up the current panel printout with actual usage.
- [ ] Rename one firmware branch to match what it *really* does.
- [ ] Ask one person to interact and only log their confusion points.

## 5 · Notes to future me (teaching cues)

- “Open” means the docs ship with the thing, not after.
- If the build can’t be explained to a beginner, the design isn’t done.
- Every knob should have a story, or it shouldn’t exist.

**Status:** rough, honest, teachable-in-progress.
