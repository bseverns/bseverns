# Part 107 + FPV Winter Packet

A practical winter arc for studying Part 107 while building FPV flow you can trust (and teach).

## How to use this packet

**Each week, do three things:**
1. Study (Part 107)
2. Reps (sim + small safe flights)
3. Make one teachable artifact (so your education side stays fed)

**Rule of progression:** one new variable at a time (new spot OR new trick OR new tune).

## Exam snapshot (UAG)

- Test: Unmanned Aircraft General - Small (UAG)
- Number of questions: 60
- Allotted time: 2.0 hours
- Passing score: 70

Keep it simple: learn the map, learn the sky, learn the rules. Then fly with craft.

---

## The "two cords" approach

- **Part 107 brain:** risk management, airspace literacy, legal limits, judgment
- **FPV body:** smooth control, intentional proximity, repeatable safety ritual
- **Bridge:** procedure as rhythm (brief -> fly -> debrief)

---

# Winter plan (8 weeks)

## Week 1 - Setup and the rules of the game
**Study**
- Read the UAS ACS table of contents and headings
- Part 107 basics: responsibilities, operating limits, VLOS concept

**Reps**
- Sim: hover, gentle turns, figure-8 at constant altitude
- Create a "hands off" failsafe habit (pause, breathe, reset)

**Make**
- Draft your 1-page **Preflight + Go/No-Go checklist** (template included below)

## Week 2 - Your safety operating system
**Study**
- Visual line of sight and what a visual observer (VO) does
- Basic right-of-way mindset (avoid manned aircraft, avoid carelessness)

**Reps**
- Sim: smooth throttle ramps (no "stairs"), constant-speed orbits

**Make**
- Print the **VO card** and the **comms phrases** page

## Week 3 - Airspace literacy
**Study**
- Controlled vs uncontrolled airspace
- Authorization concept (LAANC)

**Reps**
- Sim: slow turns, coordinated yaw, clean altitude holds

**Make**
- **Airspace scavenger hunt** worksheet for 3 locations you might teach from

## Week 4 - Charts and reading the test supplement
**Study**
- Work the FAA testing supplement charts and figures
- Do at least 2 short sets of sample questions

**Reps**
- Flight: "box pattern" at safe height, steady speed, smooth corners

**Make**
- A 10-minute mini-lesson: "How to read a sectional for drone pilots"

## Week 5 - Weather fundamentals
**Study**
- What wind and cold do to small UAS
- Basic aviation weather products (METAR/TAF concepts)

**Reps**
- Sim: "gentle chase" line (follow an imaginary skater with smooth lag)

**Make**
- Your **60-second weather brief** script and a class-friendly wind policy

## Week 6 - Performance and loading mindset
**Study**
- Weight, balance, and performance basics (battery sag, power margin)
- Human factors: fatigue, tunnel vision, temptation

**Reps**
- "One take, one pack" discipline: plan shot, fly shot, stop

**Make**
- A **risk budget** worksheet for students and for yourself

## Week 7 - Operations and emergencies
**Study**
- Lost link, flyaway prevention, emergency landing choices
- ADM: stop rules, abort rules, "no hero moves"

**Reps**
- Sim: recoveries (level out, return, land) from awkward attitudes

**Make**
- Incident and near-miss log template

## Week 8 - Bring it together (test readiness + teach readiness)
**Study**
- Take a full practice run (timed)
- Review weak ACS areas using your missed codes

**Reps**
- Flight: brief -> fly -> debrief with a VO, even if you're just practicing

**Make**
- A 60-minute class plan: "FPV with a spotter culture"

# FPV craft drills (cinematic-leaning)

1. **Constant-speed orbit:** keep distance and altitude steady.
2. **Reveal:** start behind an object, slide out slowly, no sudden yaw.
3. **Parallax pass:** move laterally; keep subject centered; steady throttle.
4. **Follow cam:** fly slower than you think; keep turns wide and smooth.
5. **Abort reps:** practice calling "abort" and landing calmly.

---

# Safety operating system

## Risk budget (per session)
Pick one spicy thing. Everything else stays boring.

- New location? Then fly easy.
- New move? Then fly familiar spot.
- New tune / build change? Then fly basic maneuvers only.

Stop while you're still winning.

## Visual observer (VO) - core expectations
- VO watches the aircraft and the airspace.
- VO has permission to call "LAND NOW" with no debate.
- VO and pilot stay in effective communication.

# Templates and printables

## Preflight + Go/No-Go checklist (1 page)
**Mission**
- What is the shot / goal?
- Who is involved (pilot, VO, helpers)?
- Where is the emergency landing area?

**Airspace**
- What airspace am I in?
- Any nearby airports / heli routes?
- Authorization needed? If yes, obtain before flight.

**Weather**
- Wind steady? Gust spread acceptable?
- Visibility and ceiling acceptable?
- Temperature: battery and fingers OK?

**Aircraft**
- Props, frame, antennas secure
- Battery seated, straps solid
- Failsafe configured (lost link behavior)
- Home point / return behavior understood (if applicable)

**People**
- Keep non-participants out of the area
- No flight over people not involved
- Clear takeoff/landing zone

**Go / No-Go**
- If anything feels rushed, stop and reset.
- If you cannot fly within VLOS, do not launch.

## 60-second weather brief (script)
- "Today: wind ___, gusts ___, temp ___."
- "Hazards: turbulence near ___, sun angle ___."
- "Battery expectation: shorter / normal."
- "No-go triggers: gust spread over ___, visibility concerns, people density."
- "Plan: short packs, planned abort points, land early."

## VO card (print)
**Your job:** eyes on aircraft + airspace, not the goggles feed.  
**Callouts**
- "Aircraft" (manned aircraft in area)
- "People" (non-participant approaching)
- "Obstacle" (new hazard)
- "Abort" (reset position)
- "LAND NOW" (immediate landing)

**Comms**
- Keep it short, plain words.
- Confirm critical calls: "copy, landing."

## Airspace scavenger hunt (worksheet)
For each location:
1. Coordinates / address:
2. What airspace?
3. Nearest airport(s):
4. Any special use airspace?
5. If controlled: how would you request authorization?
6. Your safe flight area (sketch):
7. Emergency landing options:

## Incident / near-miss log
- Date/time:
- Location:
- Aircraft:
- What happened (facts only):
- What almost happened:
- Root cause (one sentence):
- Fix (one sentence):
- Shareable lesson (for students):

## Debrief rubric
- Planning (airspace, people, weather): 1-5
- Communication (VO, callouts): 1-5
- Control (smoothness, margins): 1-5
- Judgment (aborts, stop rules): 1-5
- Notes for next session:
