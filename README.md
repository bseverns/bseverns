## Ben Severns
Educator–artist building tools that let others build.

### Intent (what these repos are / aren’t)
This is my studio bench: a public set of notebook of kits, field notes, and small systems that turn making into a repeatable practice. It’s for learning in the open, documenting experiments, and shipping usable artifacts without pretending they’re perfect. It’s not a polished product site, a corporate knowledge base, or a place where ideas get smothered in process. Think half workshop wall, half teaching guide — practical, messy, and meant to be picked up. If you want novelty, go elsewhere; if you want utility with some radical honesty, you’re home.
