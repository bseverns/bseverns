Educator–artist building tools that let others build.

### Intent (what this repo is / isn’t)
This repo is my studio bench: a public notebook of kits, field notes, and small systems that turn making into a repeatable practice. It’s for learning in the open, documenting experiments, and shipping usable artifacts without pretending they’re perfect. It’s not a polished product site, a corporate knowledge base, or a place where ideas get smothered in process. Think half workshop wall, half teaching guide — practical, messy, and meant to be picked up. If you want novelty, go elsewhere; if you want utility with some punk‑rock honesty, you’re home.

### Start here (flow)
Dashboard (`seasonDASH.md`) → Codex (`CODEX-PRACTICE.md`) → Seasonal kit (`WINTER-FIELD-KIT.md`) → Plant care (`plant-seasonal-care/`)

### Repo map (top‑level docs + why they exist)
- `README.md` — You are here. Intent + navigation.
- `seasonDASH.md` — The now-board: seasonal priorities and quick links.
- `CODEX-PRACTICE.md` — Practice notes and working conventions (the “how”).
- `WINTER-FIELD-KIT.md` — Seasonal kit: what’s in the bag and why.
- `workP.md` — Active work plan / running list.
- `PROJECT CARD · HOME PRINTLAB SETUP.md` — Project card: home lab configuration.
- `PROJECT CARD · I HOPE THE SKY WILL STILL TAKE US.md` — Project card: art/tech piece notes.
- `PROJECT CARD · MN42 (MOARkNOBS-42).md` — Project card: MN42 hardware project.

### How this pairs with studio-notes
This repo is the public workshop floor: dashboards, kits, and teachable artifacts. The private (or messier) lab notebook lives in [studio-notes](https://github.com/bseverns/studio-notes) — raw logs, deep dives, and day‑to‑day scratch. When a note in studio‑notes matures into a repeatable practice or shareable kit, it lands here.
