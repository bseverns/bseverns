# WINTER FIELD KIT
*Ben Severns – 2025–2026*

> *To track what is underway, what is buried, and what waits for frost to break.*

---

## I. Seasonal Conditions

- **Season:** Dormant / Root-deep / Circuits warm against the cold  
- **Operating Tone:** Ritual meets utility  
- **Guiding Questions:**  
  - What systems need refusal?  
  - What tools whisper instead of shout?  
  - Where is silence more generative than signal?

---

## II. Projects in Motion

### 1. I HOPE THE SKY WILL STILL TAKE US
*Industrial-noise album on drone flight, surveillance, and longing*

- **Status:** Composition & sound design in progress  
- **Textures:** Feedback shimmer, radio static, low-end unease  
- **Potential materials:** Drone telemetry, tape hiss, archival public domain films  
- **Title treatments:** ALL CAPS / stenciled / black box data aesthetic  
- **Intended release:** Late winter (ideally near solstice)

### 2. BETTER DAYS AHEAD – VIDEO ACCOMPANIMENT
*Visual companion to most recent audio release*

- **Status:** Concept gathering / footage review  
- **Visual tone:** dream-fractured / post-broadcast nostalgia / erased authorship  
- **Experiments:** Feedback loops, motion collage, blackout intervals  
- **Questions:** What happens when the image refuses the beat?

### 3. MN42 Finalization
*Critical MIDI controller nearing physical completion*

- **Status:** Hardware refinement, enclosure, firmware tweaks  
- **Deliverables:** Final schematic, annotated firmware, build guide  
- **Documentation goal:** Every file tells a story (why, not just how)  
- **Ritual addendum:** Burn a test sketch. Offer the first button press to no one.

### 4. Home Printlab Installation
*Upgrading the workshop for tactile publishing and physical ephemera*

- **Status:** Power routing / bench re-org / equipment calibration  
- **Repository:** TBD – should include wiring diagrams, part lists, layout photos  
- **Inaugural print idea:** "Field Test No. 0" – a print that doesn’t reproduce  
- **Note to self:** Capture the ambient sound of setup day. Tape it to a wall.

## III. Interludes + Unplanned Emergence

These small works will act as the spores between larger roots:

- **Zines:** Folded notes on privacy, pedagogy, refusal  
- **One-button circuits:** Tools that do very little but do it well  
- **Audio gestures:** 90-second tracks that loop into silence  
- **Unpredictable tools:** Machines that wait, stall, stutter

---

## IV. Material Practices

- Use what’s on hand.  
- Work toward reuse and decay.  
- Print what you forget.  
- Archive the mistakes that teach rhythm.

---

## V. Logbook

*Record of moments, trials, anomalies, and subtle shifts.*

### [DATE: ________]
- **Worksite:**  
- **Focus:**  
- **Duration:**  
- **Friction observed:**  
- **Breakthrough or signal:**  
- **Material evidence:**  
- **Atmospheric notes:**  

_(Duplicate this entry as needed to keep a record of movement through the season.)_

## VI. Closing Notes

This winter is not for scaling or showing.  
It is for systems that **hold**—not perform.  
It is for code that waits, circuits that listen, and interfaces that glitch kindly.  
It is for staying in the work until it begins to hum back.
