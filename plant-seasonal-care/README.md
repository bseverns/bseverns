# Houseplant & Yard Seasonal Care (GitHub bundle)

A practical, source‑linked checklist system for caring for a mixed collection of **indoor plants** and a handful of **yard trees** through the four seasons in **America/Chicago**. This is half studio notebook, half teaching guide: real‑world, repeatable, and not afraid to be a little loud.

Indoor plants in scope: **Spider plant**, **Christmas cactus**, **Rubber plant**, **Pothos**, **Aloe**, **Basil**, **Calathea**.  
Yard friends in scope: a mature **white pine**, a young **spruce** (South Dakota spruce), a **Prairie Fire crabapple**, and a young **crabapple / ornamental apple**.

## How to use this folder (read once, thank yourself later)
- Start in `seasons/` for the big‑picture rhythm (what changes, when).
- Drop into `plants/` when a specific plant is being dramatic.
- Use `water/`, `light/`, and `care/` when you’re troubleshooting.
- Keep `calendar/plant-yard-reminders.ics` on your phone so this stays boring and consistent.

## Quick indoor table (first‑pass reference)
| Plant | Light | Water | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Spider plant (*Chlorophytum comosum*) | Bright‑indirect | Keep evenly moist in growth; allow top inch to dry; flush salts | Sensitive to fluoride/salts; rain/RO/spring water helpful |
| Christmas cactus (*Schlumbergera*) | Bright‑indirect | Evenly moist in growth; slightly drier after bloom | Needs **long nights + cool** fall protocol for bud‑set |
| Rubber plant (*Ficus elastica*) | Bright‑indirect to bright filtered | Allow top 1–2" to dry | Stable temps > 54°F (12°C); wipe leaves |
| Pothos (*Epipremnum aureum*) | Low to bright‑indirect | Dry down between waterings | Easy; avoid persistent soggy soil |
| Aloe (*Aloe vera*) | Very bright, some direct; avoid scorch | Infrequent; dry out fully | Cactus mix; minimal winter water |
| Basil (*Ocimum basilicum*) | Full sun/very bright | Even moisture, never waterlogged | Annual; indoors needs **6–8h** of strong light |
| Calathea (*Calathea* spp.) | Medium to bright‑indirect, no harsh sun | Evenly moist, never soggy; soft/filtered water preferred | Loves humidity; warm (65–85°F); no fertilizer in winter |
