# Co‑Mingle Watering (shared water routines)

## Intent (why this exists)
The “one pitcher to rule them all” question. Sometimes it’s fine, sometimes it’s a fast track to unhappy leaves.

## Quick checklist
- [ ] Group plants with similar water/soil needs.
- [ ] Keep salt‑sensitive plants (calathea, spider plant) on filtered/rain water.
- [ ] Don’t share runoff between pots (cross‑contamination + fungus gnat party).

## When it’s fine
- Same soil type, same pot size, same light exposure.

## When it’s risky
- Succulents mixed with tropicals.
- Anything with active pest/fungus issues.

- See `../REFERENCES.md` for general houseplant care guidance.
