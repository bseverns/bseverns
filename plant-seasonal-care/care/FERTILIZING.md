# Fertilizing (keep it simple)

## Intent (why this exists)
Plants aren’t trying to get swole; they want a steady, light feed in the growing season and a nap in winter.

## Quick checklist
- [ ] Feed lightly in spring/summer (half‑strength is fine).
- [ ] Skip or reduce feed in fall/winter unless growth is active.
- [ ] If leaves burn or tips brown right after feeding, flush the pot.

## Seasonal rhythm
- **Spring/Summer:** monthly or every 4–6 weeks.
- **Fall/Winter:** pause or reduce.
