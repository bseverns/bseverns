# Lighting (windows, grow lights, winter survival)

## Intent (why this exists)
Light is plant food. This is the no‑nonsense guide to where plants actually thrive in a Midwest house.

## Quick checklist
- [ ] South or west windows = high light (watch for scorch).
- [ ] East window = gentle morning light.
- [ ] North window = low light (fine for pothos, rough for basil).
- [ ] If growth is leggy, **add light** before you add water.
- [ ] SAD lamps are for humans, not plants (wrong spectrum and intensity).

## Grow light basics
- Full‑spectrum LED is fine; intensity and distance matter most.
- Aim for 8–12 hours/day for light‑hungry plants.
