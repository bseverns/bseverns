# Aloe (*Aloe vera*)

## Intent (why this exists)
Succulent rules: light hard, water light. The whole vibe is “dry and bright.”

## Light
- Very bright light; some direct sun is fine if acclimated.
- Rotate the pot so the plant doesn’t lean.

## Water
- Water deeply, then let the soil dry out completely.
- Use a cactus/succulent mix; drainage is non‑negotiable.

## Seasonal checklist
- **Spring/Summer:**
  - [ ] Water every 2–4 weeks, only after full dry‑down.
  - [ ] Fertilize 1–2 times in the growing season.
- **Fall/Winter:**
  - [ ] Water sparingly (monthly or less).
  - [ ] Keep away from cold windows.

## Notes
- Mushy leaves = too much water, not enough light.
