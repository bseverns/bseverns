# Basil (*Ocimum basilicum*)

## Intent (why this exists)
Kitchen herb, full‑sun energy. Indoors it’s a light‑hungry drama queen, so plan for the grow light.

## Light
- Full sun or **very** bright light (6–8 hours/day).
- Indoors, a grow light is usually mandatory.

## Water
- Keep evenly moist, never waterlogged.
- Don’t let it fully dry out; it wilts fast.

## Seasonal checklist
- **Growing season:**
  - [ ] Pinch tops to encourage bushiness.
  - [ ] Harvest often.
  - [ ] Fertilize lightly every 2–4 weeks.
- **Late season / indoors:**
  - [ ] Increase light intensity.
  - [ ] Watch for leggy growth (needs more light).

## Notes
- This is typically an annual. If it’s flowering, pinch blooms to keep leaves tasty.
