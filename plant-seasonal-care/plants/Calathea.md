# Calathea (*Calathea* spp.)

- **Light:** Medium to bright‑indirect. No harsh direct sun; leaves scorch and colors fade.
- **Water:** Keep the mix **evenly moist** but never waterlogged. Let just the top surface dry before re‑watering.
- **Water quality:** Prefers low‑mineral, low‑fluoride water (rain, RO, or filtered) when possible.
- **Humidity:** High humidity is ideal — aim for 50–60%+ if you can. Grouping plants or using a humidifier helps.
- **Temperature:** Warm all year: roughly **65–85°F (18–29°C)**. Avoid cold drafts and sudden temperature swings.
- **Feeding:** Balanced, diluted houseplant fertilizer once a month in **spring and summer**; **no fertilizer in winter** when growth slows.
- **Winter:** Light drops and air dries out. Pull closer to your brightest, draft‑free window and watch soil moisture carefully.

This lines up with specialist houseplant guides that emphasize warm temperatures, high humidity, indirect light, and monthly feeding only in the growing season, with a pause in winter.
