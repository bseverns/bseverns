# Christmas Cactus (*Schlumbergera*)

## Intent (why this exists)
A reminder that this plant is a cactus in name only: it wants water, humidity, and a strict fall light schedule to bloom.

## Light
- Bright, indirect light year-round.
- In fall, give **long nights** (12–14 hours of darkness) to set buds.

## Water
- Keep evenly moist during growth and bloom.
- After flowering, allow slightly drier cycles but never bone‑dry.

## Seasonal checklist
- **Late summer/fall (bud set):**
  - [ ] Cool nights (55–65°F / 13–18°C).
  - [ ] 12–14 hours of darkness nightly for 6–8 weeks.
- **Bloom period:**
  - [ ] Keep soil lightly moist.
  - [ ] Avoid moving the plant once buds form.

## Notes
- Dropped buds usually mean temperature swings or light interruptions.
