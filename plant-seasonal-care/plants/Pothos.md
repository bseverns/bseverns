# Pothos (*Epipremnum aureum*)

## Intent (why this exists)
The resilient hallway warrior. This is the plant you keep to remind yourself you can keep plants.

## Light
- Low to bright‑indirect light.
- Bright light keeps variegation strong.

## Water
- Let soil dry down between waterings.
- If leaves yellow and drop, cut back on water.

## Seasonal checklist
- **Spring/Summer:**
  - [ ] Water when the pot feels light and the top inches are dry.
  - [ ] Fertilize monthly at half strength.
- **Fall/Winter:**
  - [ ] Reduce watering; skip fertilizer if growth slows.

## Notes
- Trim vines to encourage bushier growth.
