# Rubber Plant (*Ficus elastica*)

## Intent (why this exists)
Keep the big-leaf diva happy: consistent light, consistent watering, wipe the leaves, avoid cold drama.

## Light
- Bright, indirect to bright filtered light.
- Avoid harsh midday direct sun indoors unless acclimated.

## Water
- Water when top 1–2 inches of soil are dry.
- Don’t let it sit in water; roots hate soggy.

## Seasonal checklist
- **Spring/Summer:**
  - [ ] Water when top 1–2" dry.
  - [ ] Fertilize monthly at half strength.
  - [ ] Wipe leaves to keep pores open.
- **Fall/Winter:**
  - [ ] Reduce watering.
  - [ ] Skip fertilizer if growth slows.

## Notes
- Temperatures should stay above ~54°F (12°C).
