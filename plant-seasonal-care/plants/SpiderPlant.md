# Spider Plant (*Chlorophytum comosum*)

## Intent (why this exists)
A quick, lived-in guide for keeping spider plants chill and green indoors. This is the “don’t overthink it” plant, but salts and fluoride can sneak up on you.

## Light
- Bright, indirect light is the sweet spot.
- Handles lower light, but growth slows and variegation fades.

## Water
- Let the top inch of soil dry out before watering again.
- Flush the pot occasionally to clear mineral buildup.
- If tips brown a lot, try filtered, rain, or RO water.

## Seasonal checklist
- **Spring/Summer:**
  - [ ] Water when top inch is dry.
  - [ ] Fertilize lightly every 4–6 weeks.
- **Fall/Winter:**
  - [ ] Reduce watering frequency.
  - [ ] Skip fertilizer if growth pauses.

## Notes
- Likes being a bit rootbound.
- Brown tips usually mean salts/fluoride or inconsistent watering.
