# Fall (Sep–Nov)
**Theme:** taper water and fertilizer, set buds for Schlumbergera, and tuck the yard in for winter.

- **Reduce feeding** to monthly or stop entirely by late fall for most indoor plants.
- **Water less often** as growth slows; aim for thorough watering with full drain‑off, then let the top of the mix dry.
- **Deep clean**: prune tired growth, remove debris, sanitize shears between plants.

**Christmas cactus bud‑set protocol** (roughly mid‑Sep to late Oct)
- Aim for **12–14 hours of uninterrupted darkness** each night.
- Keep nights **cool** (around 55–60°F / 12–15°C) for 4–6 weeks.
- Keep soil evenly moist (not wet). Once buds set, avoid moving the plant until they are secure.

**Indoor specifics**
- *Spider plant*: watch for tip burn as indoor heat rises — flush salts; consider rain/RO water if tips brown.
- *Rubber plant*: keep away from cold drafts near windows; maintain temps above ~54°F / 12°C.
- *Pothos*: move closer to your brightest window to prevent legginess.
- *Aloe*: maximum light; very light watering.
- *Basil*: last big flush indoors; strong light or retire and restart from cuttings.
- *Calathea*: light starts to drop — pull closer to the window, hold fertilizer late in fall, and stay vigilant on humidity.

**Yard notes**
- Water **young** trees deeply until the ground begins to freeze, especially if fall is dry.
- Top up mulch around the root zones (3–4" deep, pulled back from the trunk).
- Rake leaves out of trunks and against foundations, but let some leaf litter live in beds for soil life if desired.
