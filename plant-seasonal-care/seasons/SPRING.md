# Spring (Mar–May)
**Theme:** wake‑up, repot, feed lightly, shape — indoors and out.

- **Repot / top‑dress** indoor plants if roots circle the pot or the mix is tired (every 1–3 years). Refresh the top 1–2 cm of mix on large specimens.
- **Resume feeding** at half strength every 2–3 waterings for active growers (Spider plant, Pothos, Rubber plant, Basil, Calathea, Christmas cactus once it breaks new growth). Skip Aloe for now.
- **Increase light** as the sun angle improves; rotate pots every 1–2 weeks for even growth.
- **Prune & clean**: remove dead leaves, soft‑pinch leggy vines (Pothos, Basil), wipe large leaves (Rubber plant, Calathea).
- **Pest check** weekly (mealybug, scale, mites); isolate and treat early.

**Indoor specifics**
- *Spider plant*: divide or root plantlets now; flush the pot to reduce salts.
- *Christmas cactus*: after winter bloom and a short rest, resume watering/feeding when new segments appear.
- *Rubber plant*: up‑pot or root tip cuttings if you want to control height.
- *Pothos*: reset vines to a moss pole if you want bigger leaves.
- *Aloe*: only repot if pot‑bound; keep water sparse.
- *Basil*: start fresh seed under strong light; harden to a bright windowsill once robust.
- *Calathea*: repot when root‑bound; resume monthly feeding with filtered/low‑mineral water and watch humidity.

**Yard notes**
- Inspect trees for winter damage; prune out broken branches on a dry day.
- Refresh mulch rings (3–4" deep, not touching the trunk), extending toward the drip line.
- Begin deep watering **young** trees during dry spells once the ground fully thaws.
