# Summer (Jun–Aug)
**Theme:** growth, airflow, consistency — plus deep drinks for young trees in drought.

- **Watering rhythm indoors**: check soil 2–3×/week; heat drives faster dry‑downs.
- **Ventilation**: avoid stagnant corners; a small fan on low improves resilience.
- **Fertilize** modestly: half‑strength every 2–4 weeks for actively growing plants (not Aloe).
- **Light management**: protect from midday scorch behind sheer curtains; keep Calathea out of harsh sun.

**Indoor specifics**
- *Spider plant*: pups galore — harvest to propagate or trim for shape.
- *Christmas cactus*: can enjoy a shaded outdoor vacation if safe; avoid intense sun and heavy rain.
- *Rubber plant*: steady moisture; wipe dust monthly to keep stomata clear.
- *Pothos*: trim and re‑plant cuttings to thicken planters.
- *Aloe*: allow full dry‑downs; brief morning sun is fine; avoid water sitting in the rosette.
- *Basil*: harvest frequently; pinch flower spikes to prolong leafy growth.
- *Calathea*: watch humidity; avoid crispy edges by keeping air moist and water consistent.

**Yard notes**
- During hot, dry stretches, deeply water **young** trees once a week; soak the root zone to 6–9" depth instead of frequent light sprinkles.
- Mature trees need deep watering only during extended droughts.
- Check mulch: maintain a wide, even ring, never piled against the trunk.
