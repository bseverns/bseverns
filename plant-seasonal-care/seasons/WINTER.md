# Winter (Dec–Feb)
**Theme:** light scarcity, dry indoor air, frozen or resting soil outdoors.

- **Light indoors**: cluster plants in the brightest exposures; supplement with grow lights if possible. SAD lamps are for people, not plants.
- **Humidity**: group plants; use trays with pebbles + water (pot above waterline). Humidifiers help Calathea most of all.
- **Watering**: lengthen intervals; always check soil before watering. Avoid cold water on roots.
- **Fertilizer**: **pause** for most species; resume late winter as growth restarts.
- **Sanation**: never let different plants share runoff; clean tools between plants.

**Indoor specifics**
- *Spider plant*: watch for heater drafts; trim brown tips; low‑salt water helps.
- *Christmas cactus*: after bloom, give a 4–6 week rest slightly drier and without fertilizer.
- *Rubber plant*: steady temps; wipe leaves (dry air accumulates dust).
- *Pothos*: cut back leggy vines; root cuttings to refill sparse pots.
- *Aloe*: bright window; minimal water — think “desert winter.”
- *Basil*: needs **high light** to be worthwhile now; otherwise, grow microgreens instead.
- *Calathea*: keep away from drafts and radiators; no fertilizer; watch that it doesn’t fully dry out between careful waterings.

**Yard notes**
- On milder winter days when the ground is **thawed** and it’s been dry, give young evergreens and crabapples a deep drink.
- Check mulch rings after freeze/thaw cycles; repair any bare spots and keep mulch away from direct contact with trunks.
- Brush off heavy, wet snow from young spruce branches if it threatens to bend or break them; let snow over the root zone act as insulation.
