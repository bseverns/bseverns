# Water Quality (tap, spring, rain, RO)

## Intent (why this exists)
Plants don’t just drink water; they drink **everything in the water**. This doc is the “don’t wreck your leaves with invisible stuff” guide.

## Quick checklist
- [ ] If tips brown a lot, test filtered or rain water for a month.
- [ ] Let chlorinated water sit out 24 hours (helps chlorine, **not** chloramine).
- [ ] If you have chloramine, use a filter rated for it or RO water.
- [ ] Flush soil monthly for salt‑sensitive plants (spider plant, calathea).

## What matters
- **Chlorine:** can dissipate with time.
- **Chloramine:** does **not** dissipate; needs filtration.
- **Hardness/alkalinity:** can cause salt buildup and crispy tips.
