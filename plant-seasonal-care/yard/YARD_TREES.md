# Yard Trees & Big Friends — Seasonal Overview

In parallel to your indoor crew, you’ve got:
- **Grandpa** — a 100+ year old white pine
- **Spruce Willis** — a ~7‑year‑old South Dakota spruce (spruce‑type evergreen)
- **Edna Crabapplous** — Prairie Fire crabapple
- **Milton** — a young ornamental apple (Mongolian / Paradise type, ~5 years)

The indoor files in `seasons/` include a short “yard” note each season. This file zooms out on the overall rhythm.

## Water

- **Newer / young trees (first 3–5 years):**
  - Deeply water the root zone during dry spells in **spring, summer, and fall**, roughly once per week in drought, every 1–2 weeks in normal dry stretches.
  - Focus water at the **root zone**, not the trunk, and let water soak to 6–9" depth rather than frequent, shallow sprinkles.

- **Mature, well‑established trees (like Grandpa):**
  - Usually fine on rainfall alone, except in extended drought. In drought summers, consider a deep soak every few weeks.

- **Winter:**
  - If the ground is **not frozen** and there’s been little snow or rain, a deep watering on mild days helps evergreens resist winter desiccation.

## Mulch

- Maintain a **3–4" deep mulch ring** under each tree, kept a few inches away from the trunk flare and extending toward the drip line as space allows.
- No landscape fabric under the mulch; it interferes with the benefits of mulch.
- Refresh or top‑up mulch in **spring** and **fall** as needed.

## Pruning & structure

- Reserve major pruning for **late winter to very early spring** before bud‑break for most trees, unless local disease guidance suggests otherwise.
- For the crabapples:
  - Remove dead, crossing, or inward‑growing branches.
  - Keep an open, airy canopy to reduce disease pressure.

## Winter protection for younger trees

- Check that mulch still covers a wide root zone.
- Where rodent or rabbit pressure is high, consider a breathable trunk guard or hardware cloth barrier around the lower stem.
- After heavy snows, gently shake excess snow from young spruce branches, but let snow sit over the root zone as a natural blanket.
