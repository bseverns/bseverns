## 2 · Season Conditions (Summary)

- **Season:** Winter 2025–26  
- **Operating tone:** Ritual + pragmatic  
- **Primary questions right now:**
  - What systems need refusal, not refinement?
  - Where is silence more generative than signal?
  - How can tools stay legible without becoming armor?

If these questions feel off mid-season, change them. The dashboard is allowed to drift.

## 3 · Project Strips

### 3.1 · I HOPE THE SKY WILL STILL TAKE US

**Intent (short):**  
Industrial-noise / drone-flight album about sky, surveillance, and longing.

**This season’s scope:**  
- Gather raw textures and “sky banks” (e.g., DiceLoop + Microgranny or equivalent rigs).  
- Find 3–6 pieces that feel like the spine of the record.  
- Test how much beauty you’re willing to allow inside the subject matter.

**Soft floor notes:**  
- No damage to hearing, sleep, or core obligations.  
- Album is *one* chapter, not the final word.

**Practices to invoke:**  
- From Codex:
  - 1× **Embodied Glitch Walk** with actual sky in the route.  
  - 1× **Piece Without Notes** (a track/interlude released without explanation).  
  - Regular **Weather Reports** when sleep or mood shift around this work.

**Tiny Next Moves (pick one):**  
- [ ] Record one new long-form texture (10+ minutes) with no editing.  
- [ ] Write 3 “weather tag” phrases for existing sketches.  
- [ ] Do a 10-minute listen-only session (no tweaking) and log Sky/Wind/Pressure.

### 3.2 · MOARkNOBS-42 (MN42)

**Intent (short):**  
Open, legible, critical MIDI controller that can be audited, rebuilt, and misused.

**This season’s scope:**  
- Lock in v1 hardware decisions (panel, IO, connectors).  
- Reach a “teachable” firmware state (stable core modes, not every dream).  
- Produce at least one honest build/usage guide.

**Soft floor notes:**  
- No heroic hardware sprints that wreck health.  
- This version may be “reference build,” not final product.

**Practices to invoke:**  
- From Codex:
  - Use **Soft Failure** framing for prototypes (each rev lives in a container).  
  - Add at least one entry to the **Contradiction Index** after a real user test.  
  - Schedule a small **Rot Point**: one “must-have” feature that can be dropped.

**Tiny Next Moves (pick one):**  
- [ ] Mark up current panel printout with what actually gets used.  
- [ ] Rename one firmware branch to reflect what it *really* does.  
- [ ] Ask one person to interact with MN42 and only log their confusion points.

### 3.3 · Home Printlab

**Intent (short):**  
Turn the home print space into a usable, kind, and safe tool ecosystem—not a shrine.

**This season’s scope:**  
- Get core machines powered, networked (if needed), and printing.  
- Establish one or two documented workflows (e.g., “.stl → Cura → LulzBot Mini”).  
- Make the space feel inviting rather than “under construction.”

**Soft floor notes:**  
- Safety (power, fumes, trip hazards) before aesthetics.  
- Shared living space still works for everyone else.

**Practices to invoke:**  
- From Codex:
  - Run an **Embodied Glitch Walk** through the lab route.  
  - Use **Permissions to Forget** on unused stations/ideas.  
  - Log a few **Weather Reports** tagged “lab” during heavy setup weeks.

**Tiny Next Moves (pick one):**  
- [ ] Clear one complete tool path (e.g., slicing station → printer).  
- [ ] Label 3 high-friction drawers/boxes with what they *actually* hold.  
- [ ] Do one full “idea → print” run and note every snag point.

## 4 · Interludes / Spores

Short works that don’t need full project cards but still matter.

- **Zines / one-sheets:**  
  - [ ] One card about drones + consent.  
  - [ ] One card about “tools that whisper.”

- **Small sound objects:**  
  - [ ] 90-second loop or noise piece that might live between album tracks.  

- **Lab oddities:**  
  - [ ] Print one “mystery object” to live in the lab with no label.

These are optional spores that can grow into future projects or just season the current ones.

## 5 · Season Check-Ins

You can reuse this section every winter; just change the dates.

**Mid-winter check (date):** `______________`  

- What feels over-scoped?  
  > __________________________________________  
- What unexpectedly came alive?  
  > __________________________________________  
- One system (tool, habit, assumption) to gently retire:  
  > __________________________________________  

**End-of-winter note (date):** `______________`  

- Where did the Codex actually help?  
  > __________________________________________  
- Where did you ignore it (and was that good)?  
  > __________________________________________  
- One sentence to carry into the next season:  
  > __________________________________________
