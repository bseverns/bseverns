## · TABLE OF CONTENTS (MAP + PURPOSES)

**0 · HOW TO USE THIS CODEX**  
How to handle the thing: modular pages, printing, rearranging, dating revisions, and the marking system.  
When to reach for it (before a project, after something breaks, at season shifts).

**1 · PRACTICES FOR SOFT FAILURE**  
Ways to let things fall without shattering the whole system.  
Micro–Collapse Protocol, soft floors, small containers, and quick “gentle autopsies” instead of self-destructs.

**2 · PERMISSIONS TO FORGET**  
Structures for setting things down on purpose instead of dragging them forever.  
License to Forget card, and the COMPOST page where dead projects rot into nutrients (or just rot).

Local, provisional definitions of system, glitch, repair, contradiction, joy.  
A place to write your own versions and test them against real projects over time.

**4 · NEW SEASONAL LOGICS**  
Rain / Wind / Long Shadow as pacing tools bigger than a to-do list.  
Rain for bursts and puddles, Wind for circulation and drift, Long Shadow for long-range consequences.

**5 · RITUALS OF DECAY & REMAKING**  
Formalized ways to mark that you’ve changed.  
Scheduled Rot (wounding pages on purpose) and the Contradiction Index (tensions you agree not to ignore).

**6 · BLANK MODULE TEMPLATE**  
A scaffold for whatever future practices you invent.  
Keeps new sections structurally similar without deciding in advance what they must be.

### Sideways Modules (Edges of the Codex)

**· Embodied Knowing (Off-Screen Practice)**  
Keeps the body in the room: routes, posture, micro-walks, and small physical adjustments as systems work.

**· Anti-README / Anti-Instruction**  
Protects a wild zone where some pieces exist without being explained.  
Exercises in not prefacing everything, and in letting one work per season travel without text.

**· Weather Report (Inner Weather)**  
A way to log mood and pressure as weather, not as defects.  
Weekly Sky/Wind/Pressure notes, plus small experiments linking inner weather back to the systems that shape it.


---

## 0 · HOW TO USE THIS CODEX

- Treat each section as **modular**. You can:
  - Print selected pages.
  - Rearrange them.
  - Annotate, tape over, or delete entire chunks.
- Let it **age**:
  - Add dates when you revise a section.
  - Let some pages go out of date on purpose.
- Use it in **short bursts**:
  - Before a project starts.
  - When something breaks.
  - At the end of a season or cycle.

**Marking system**

- `▢` = something you can try today.  
- `✂︎ TEAR LINE` = a place where you are invited to literally cut, tear, or remove.  
- `[   ]` = space for your own additions / contradictions.

---

## 1 · PRACTICES FOR SOFT FAILURE

Soft failure is a way to fall without pretending you didn’t,  
and without shattering the whole system.

### 1.1 · Micro–Collapse Protocol

Use when you’re about to try something risky but important.

1. **Name the container**  
   Write: _“If this fails, it only breaks: ____one print run____.”_  
   - Keep the circle small: one afternoon, one prototype, one scene.

2. **Set a soft floor**  
   ▢ Define what must **not** be harmed:
   - People’s safety: `_______See below._________`
   - Relationships: `___Your word is your bond. Trust is the ground.___`
   - Minimum resources: `____What is needed to maintain attention?_______`

3. **Run the attempt**  
   Let it wobble. Note any signs of strain in the system.

4. **Gentle autopsy (15 minutes max)**  
   - What bent?  
   - What held?  
   - What surprised you?  

   Write one sentence for each, then stop. No spiral, no self-trial.

✂︎ **TEAR LINE**  
Tear this strip off after the autopsy and staple it to whatever you broke, as a tag:  
_“This failed softly on (date) ______. It taught me: ______________________.”_

### 1.2 · The Failure Quota

Failure is not an exception; it’s a quota you’re allowed to meet.

1. Set a **small quota** for a project cycle (week / month / season):  
   - “I will collect **3 soft failures** by: _______________ [date].”

2. Each time something fails without harming your soft floor:
   - ▢ Log it in three lines:
     1. What I tried: `_________________________`
     2. What failed (mechanically): `____________`
     3. What was still intact (systemically): `___`

3. When the quota is reached:
   - Take 20 minutes to scan the three logs.
   - Circle anything that feels like a **pattern**.
   - Decide: “I retire this pattern” or “I lean into this pattern.”

4. Optional ritual:  
   Burn / shred / crumple the logs and keep only a **one-line summary** of the pattern.

> Soft failure is rehearsal for risk.  
> The goal is not avoiding collapse, but making collapse survivable and legible.

---

## 2 · PERMISSIONS TO FORGET

Forgetting is not always neglect; sometimes it is pruning.

### 2.1 · License to Forget (carryable card)

Cut this out. Put it in your notebook or wallet.

> **LICENSE TO FORGET**  
> Holder: `_______________________`  
>  
> You have standing permission to forget:
> - Projects that no longer match your values.  
> - Metrics that were inherited, not chosen.  
> - Roles you were drafted into instead of accepting.  
>  
> Conditions:
> - You honor any people who would be harmed by this forgetting.  
> - You write down, once, why you are setting it down.  
>  
> Signature: `________________`   Date: `___________`

✂︎ **TEAR LINE**  
After using this once, you may tear the card in half and make a new one with different conditions.

### 2.2 · The Compost Pile

Not every idea needs archiving; some need decomposition.

1. Reserve a page (or folder) titled **COMPOST**.  
2. Whenever a project, concept, or plan feels heavy but unfinished:
   - ▢ Move it to COMPOST with a date and a one-sentence note:
     - “I’m letting this rot because: ___________________.”

3. Every season:
   - Read only the **oldest** 3–5 entries.
   - Ask:
     - Is there a nutrient here? (a method, phrase, contact, pattern)
     - Or is this just mass?

4. Pull out at most **one** nutrient per item.  
   Rewrite it somewhere active.  
   Cross out the original COMPOST entry with a single line.

> The point is not to keep everything.  
> The point is to let some things return to soil.

---

## 3 · WORKING DEFINITIONS (REVISION-READY)

These are not universal. They are provisional, local to you.  
You are invited to overwrite them.

### 3.1 · System

> A system is a pattern of relationships that keeps making more of itself.

- It is not just components; it is **flows**: attention, power, resources, signals.
- Systems can be tiny (a morning routine) or sprawling (an educational apparatus).
- A system is what keeps happening even when no one intends it anymore.

▢ **Field test:**  
Choose a project you’re inside.  
List:
- Elements: `people, tools, places, rules`
- Flows: `who moves what to whom, and when`

Then ask: _“What keeps this pattern going when I’m tired?”_  
That’s the system.

**SYSTEM, YOUR VERSION**

`SYSTEM, YOUR VERSION: _________________________________________________`

`______________________________________________________________________`

`______________________________________________________________________`

### 3.2 · Glitch

> A glitch is a visible misalignment that reveals how the system actually works.

- Glitches are not just errors; they are **moments of truth**.
- They show hidden assumptions, default settings, power lines.

▢ **Field test:**  
Next time something “just doesn’t work,” instead of smoothing it over, ask:
- Who is this broken for?
- Who is it still working for?
- What assumption failed?

Record one sentence and call it a **glitch note**.

### 3.3 · Repair

> Repair is any act that changes a system so that more beings can continue with less harm.

- Not all repairs return things to their previous state.
- Some repairs are **subtractive**: removing a harmful rule.
- Some repairs are **redistributive**: moving load from one person to many.

▢ **Field test:**  
Before you “fix” something, note:
- _“Who benefits from the current brokenness?”_  
- _“Who benefits from my proposed repair?”_  

If the answers are the same, consider whether you’re patching, not repairing.

### 3.4 · Contradiction

> A contradiction is when two truths, both real, cannot both win under the current rules.

- Example: “Everyone is welcome” vs. “We only meet at 7am across town.”
- Contradictions often live in schedules, budgets, and building layouts.

▢ **Field test:**  
Write one contradiction you’re carrying:

> _I am trying to be both `__________` and `__________` in a system that only rewards `__________`._

Contradictions don’t always resolve; sometimes they just become more explicit and shared.

### 3.5 · Joy

> Joy is the sensation of being briefly in right relation—with yourself, with others, with the work, with the world.

- Not constant happiness. Not productivity.
- Often small, often quiet, often shared.

▢ **Field test:**  
At the end of a day, ask:
- “Where did I feel a small spark of aliveness that wasn’t extractive?”  

Write one line. Protect that condition.

---

## 4 · NEW SEASONAL LOGICS

These logics are ways of pacing work across cycles larger than a to-do list.

### 4.1 · Rain Logic

Rain doesn’t schedule itself; it arrives in bursts, saturates, then drains.

Use Rain Logic when:
- You’re in a period of many ideas, limited time.
- You need to soak a field, not water each leaf.

**Principles**

- Accept **clusters**: work in intense, time-boxed showers.
- Let water **pool**: don’t immediately resolve everything.

▢ **Practice: The Downpour Session**

1. Set a 60–90 minute window: “Rain is allowed here.”
2. In that time:
   - Start as many small moves as you can (sketches, notes, emails, prototypes).
   - Do not finish them.
3. At the end:
   - Circle 1–2 things that feel like puddles worth returning to.
   - Everything else: let evaporate unless they reappear later.

Write:  
“Rain day on ________. What remained in the puddles: ______________.”

### 4.2 · Wind Logic

Wind moves through spaces, invisible but traceable by what it touches.

Use Wind Logic when:
- You need circulation: ideas stuck in one room, file, group.
- You want cross-pollination without heavy structure.

**Principles**

- Move **light** and often: share drafts, half-finished objects.
- Accept drift: not everything lands where you intend.

▢ **Practice: The Draft Drift**

1. Pick one unfinished thing.  
2. Send or show it to **one person** with a simple prompt:
   - “Notice anything?” or “Where does this want to go?”
3. Note their response; do not defend the work.  
4. Decide:
   - Push it further,  
   - Let it continue drifting,  
   - Or let it leave your hands entirely.

Wind logic honors the path work takes after it leaves you.

### 4.3 · Long Shadow Logic

When the sun is low, every object throws a long shadow.  
Long Shadow logic is about consequences stretched across years.

Use it when:
- You’re making choices that will outlive a semester, a grant cycle, a job.

**Principles**

- Ask not only “What do we do now?” but “What becomes easier / harder later because of this?”
- Cast a **shadow sketch** for major decisions.

▢ **Practice: Shadow Sketch**

For a decision you’re facing, draw three lines:

- 3 months from now: `_____________________`
- 3 years from now: `______________________`
- 13 years from now: `_____________________`

Who is standing in these shadows?  
What do they inherit from your choice—tools, stories, debt, warmth?

✂︎ **TEAR LINE**  
Tear off your shadow sketch and tape it where you’ll see it again.  
Revisit it when one of those dates arrives.

---

## 5 · RITUALS OF DECAY & REMAKING

This codex should not remain pristine. It should show its use.

### 5.1 · Scheduled Rot

Pick a repeating date (first day of each new season, or a solstice, or your birthday).

On that day:

▢ **1. Select pages to wound**  
   - Choose at least one page that no longer feels right.
   - Circle any sentence that makes you wince.

▢ **2. Mark decay**  
   - Cross out what no longer holds.  
   - Write in the margin:  
     - “This belonged to a past version of me who needed: _______.”

▢ **3. Destroy something small**  
   - Tear off a corner, erase a diagram, remove a definition.
   - Optional: compost, burn, recycle the torn piece.

▢ **4. Add a replacement seed**  
   - On the next blank space, write one new sentence, practice, or question.

> Decay is not a bug in your practice; it’s the only evidence it’s alive.

### 5.2 · The Contradiction Index

Keep a running list of tensions that refuse to resolve.

1. Title a page: **CONTRADICTION INDEX**.  
2. Each time you meet a core contradiction:
   - Write it as a short, sharp line:
     - “We say we center kids; we center schedules.”
3. Once a month:
   - Pick one contradiction and ask:
     - Can this be **designed around**?  
     - Must this be **named and held**?  
     - Or does this require a **change of system**, not a change of habit?

You do not have to solve the Index.  
You just have to stop pretending it isn’t there.

---

## 6 · BLANK MODULE TEMPLATE (FOR YOUR FUTURE SECTIONS)

Use this when you invent new logics, rituals, or practices.

### [Module Title Here]

**Why this exists**  
_One sentence: what hurt, gap, or desire is this responding to?_

**When to use it**  
- `___________`  
- `___________`  

**Practice**  
▢ Step 1: `__________________________`  
▢ Step 2: `__________________________`  
▢ Step 3: `__________________________`  

**Aftercare / Reflection**  
- What did this shift?  
- What did this reveal?  

✂︎ **TEAR LINE**  
_Instructions for how this module may be torn, retired, or rewritten._

---

## 7 · VERSION FOOTER

When you next revise this codex:

- Change the version tag on the front.
- Date the revision here:

> v________ made on `__________` after:  
> - a failure  
> - a season change  
> - a conversation  
> - a glitch worth keeping

You are not obligated to keep any of this.  
You are invited to keep **just enough** to make the next version more honest.

## 6 · EMBODIED KNOWING (OFF-SCREEN PRACTICE)

Words are not the only way the system speaks. The body keeps logs too.

### 6.1 · Embodied Glitch Walk

**Why this exists**  
To notice where systems live in your muscles, posture, and routes—not only in your notes and files.

**When to use it**  
- When you are stuck in a purely conceptual loop.  
- When decisions feel abstract, but your body feels heavy, wired, or numb.

**Practice**  
▢ Step 1: Choose a small route you know well.  
- Example: desk → kitchen → bathroom → hallway → desk.  

▢ Step 2: Walk it **as slowly as you can** once.  
- Each time you are forced to adapt (step over cable, twist around chair, bend under shelf), quietly name a “glitch note” in your head.  
  - “Trip point.”  
  - “Neck crank.”  
  - “Eye squeeze at bright screen.”

▢ Step 3: When you return, write down only the **three glitch notes you still remember**.  
- Next to each, note:  
  - “This is caused by: ________.”  
  - “I could change this by: ________ (or decide not to).”

**Aftercare / Reflection**  
- What did your body know that your schedule did not?  
- Is there one small physical repair you can make this week (reroute a cable, move a light, change a chair) as a systems intervention?

✂︎ **TEAR LINE**  
Tear off one glitch note you are *not* ready to fix. Let the page live with that gap.


---

## 7 · ANTI-README / ANTI-INSTRUCTION MODES

Sometimes clarity becomes armor. These practices rehearse opacity and trust.

### 7.1 · The Piece Without Notes

**Why this exists**  
To make at least one work per season that does **not** depend on your language to matter.

**When to use it**  
- Once per season, when you feel the urge to explain a thing into safety.

**Practice**  
▢ Step 1: Make a small work (sound, object, script, performance, patch).  
▢ Step 2: Do **not** write instructions, wall text, README, or caption.  
▢ Step 3: Show it to at least one person.  
- If they ask, “What is this?”, answer only with:  
  - “What did you notice?” or  
  - “What did it do to you?”

**Aftercare / Reflection**  
- In the Codex, log:  
  - “Piece without notes on ________.”  
  - “Most surprising reaction: __________________.”  
- Do *not* go back and “fix” the piece with retroactive explanation.

---

### 7.2 · Instruction Fast (24 Hours)

**Why this exists**  
To feel your own dependence on frames, disclaimers, and context-setting.

**When to use it**  
- On a low-stakes studio day.  
- When you catch yourself over-explaining everything.

**Practice**  
▢ Step 1: Declare a 24-hour “instruction fast.”  
- You may answer questions, but you may not preface or pre-explain your work.  

▢ Step 2: If you feel compelled to explain, write the explanation **privately** in the Codex instead of saying it aloud.

▢ Step 3: At the end of the 24 hours, read what you wrote.

**Aftercare / Reflection**  
- Which explanations were truly needed?  
- Which were about protecting yourself rather than the other person?

✂︎ **TEAR LINE**  
Tear off one written explanation you decide no one actually needed and compost it.


---

## 8 · POROUS EDGES (CO-AUTHORSHIP)

This codex does not have to speak in a single voice.

### 8.1 · Co-Author Margin

**Why this exists**  
To let other hands and minds leave marks on your practice document.

**When to use it**  
- When you work with a collaborator, student, or co-teacher.  
- When you feel the Codex getting too “sealed.”

**Practice**  
▢ Step 1: Choose one page you’re willing to open.  
▢ Step 2: Hand it to someone else with a simple prompt:  
- “Mark what confuses you.”  
- “Underline what feels alive.”  
- “Cross out what feels false.”

▢ Step 3: Do not defend or explain while they mark.

**Aftercare / Reflection**  
- Note one change you’ll make **because of** their marks.  
- Note one thing you will stubbornly keep, and why.

---

### 8.2 · Draft as Offering

**Why this exists**  
To practice letting go of control over how work travels.

**When to use it**  
- When you have a half-finished thing you’re clinging to.

**Practice**  
▢ Step 1: Choose a draft (audio, code, syllabus, diagram).  
▢ Step 2: Send it to one person with a single line:  
- “You may keep, alter, or ignore this entirely.”  

▢ Step 3: Do not follow up unless they initiate.

**Aftercare / Reflection**  
- Log whether anything came back.  
- Honor that “no response” is also data about how work moves (or doesn’t).


---

## 9 · EMOTIONAL WEATHER

Not everything has to route through critique or productivity. Some things are just weather.

### 9.1 · Inner Weather Report

**Why this exists**  
To register feeling without immediately weaponizing it into output.

**When to use it**  
- Once per week, at a consistent time.  
- After an especially charged session (good or bad).

**Practice**  
▢ Step 1: Title a page: **WEATHER – [SEASON / YEAR]**.  
▢ Step 2: Once a week, write three lines:  
- Sky: one word for how you feel overall.  
- Wind: one sentence your body keeps saying (e.g., “I’m tired,” “I want to stop,” “I want to keep going”).  
- Pressure: one situation that is bearing down on you (no analysis).

**Aftercare / Reflection**  
- At the end of a season, scan the page.  
- Circle any phrases that keep returning.  
- Ask gently: “Does any of this want a system change, or just rest?”


---

### 9.2 · System–Weather Crossfade

**Why this exists**  
To notice when your internal weather is caused by the systems you’ve built.

**When to use it**  
- When your Inner Weather Report repeats the same word three times or more.

**Practice**  
▢ Step 1: Take one repeated word (e.g., “overwhelmed,” “flat,” “wired”).  
▢ Step 2: Ask:  
- “Which system in my life is amplifying this?”  
- “Which system is softening it?”

▢ Step 3: Write one tiny design nudge for each:  
- “Turn this knob down by: _________.”  
- “Protect this buffer by: _________.”

**Aftercare / Reflection**  
- Treat these as experiments, not verdicts.  
- Revisit after a month to see if anything changed.


---

## 10 · THE BINDER INSTRUMENT (MN42 / DICELOOP / ETC.)

The binder is not just storage. It can be a rig: a low-cost, reconfigurable instrument.

### 10.1 · Binder Layout

**Why this exists**  
To give physical form to the practice: a portable console that can hold MN42, DiceLoop, and whatever comes next.

**When to use it**  
- When printing this Codex.  
- When a project graduates from “idea” to “ongoing instrument.”

**Practice**  
▢ Step 1: Choose a binder that feels like gear, not just admin.  
- Tabs (suggested):  
  - **CODEX**  
  - **INSTRUMENTS** (MN42, DiceLoop, future rigs)  
  - **PROJECT LOGS**  
  - **COMPOST**  
  - **FIELD NOTES**

▢ Step 2: Under **INSTRUMENTS**, give each instrument a mini-section:  
- One page: “What this instrument is trying to do.”  
- One page: “How this instrument fails gracefully.”  
- One page: patches / settings you actually use.

▢ Step 3: For **DiceLoop** in particular (as low-cost “next instrument”):  
- Make a simple grid page:  
  - Columns = parameters (tempo band, texture, density, register, effect).  
  - Rows = dice results (1–6).  
- When you roll, you “play the binder” by following the row for each parameter.  
- Mark especially good rolls with a small ✳ next to the row.

**Aftercare / Reflection**  
- Once a month, flip the **INSTRUMENTS** tab:  
  - Circle one setting / patch that keeps returning.  
  - Cross out one that never gets used.  
- Let the binder show you which instruments are alive and which are ready for compost.

✂︎ **TEAR LINE**  
When an instrument is officially retired, move its pages to **COMPOST** with a one-line obituary:
> “This instrument taught me: __________ and is now returned to parts.”

## 11 · DICELOOP – HAND-PLAYED INSTRUMENT

*DiceLoop is just an audio effect. The instrument is you + the knobs + the binder.*

### 11.1 · Name the Panel

First, pin down how you think about the front panel in practice.

List the controls in the language you actually use while playing:

- KNOB 1: __________________  (e.g. MIX / INTENSITY / “HOW MUCH DAMAGE”)
- KNOB 2: __________________  (e.g. TIME / SIZE / “SMEAR”)
- KNOB 3: __________________  (e.g. FEEDBACK / HOLD)
- KNOB 4: __________________  (e.g. TONE / DARK–BRIGHT)
- KNOB 5: __________________  (e.g. TEXTURE / CRUSH)
- SWITCH / BUTTONS (if any):  
  - __________________  (e.g. FREEZE, ALT MODE)
  - __________________

> You can re-write these later if your understanding of the effect changes.

---

### 11.2 · DiceLoop Row Shapes (By Feel, Not Numbers)

When you roll 1d6, you’re not setting CC values—you’re choosing a **gesture**.

Use this table as a **starting set of “feels.”**  
Translate to knob positions by ear and mark rough positions (e.g. “9h”, “noon”, “max”).

| d6 | MIX / DEPTH      | TIME / SIZE         | FEEDBACK / HOLD      | TONE / BRIGHTNESS     | TEXTURE / DIRT        | SHORT TAG (WHAT THIS IS FOR)      |
|----|------------------|---------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 1  | low              | long / smeared      | low                  | dark                  | low–medium            | distant ghost, under the track    |
| 2  | low–medium       | long                | medium               | dark–neutral          | medium                | worn tape / background motion     |
| 3  | medium           | medium              | medium               | neutral               | low–medium            | steady body, “default sky”        |
| 4  | medium–high      | short–medium        | high                 | neutral–bright        | medium–high           | pushing forward, rhythmic smear   |
| 5  | high             | short               | very high / almost self-osc | bright / sharp | high                  | panic mode, near overflow         |
| 6  | changing / swing | changing / swing    | changing / swing     | changing / swing      | changing / swing      | storm cell / whatever happens     |

**Practice**

1. Roll 1d6. Go to that row.  
2. Set each knob **by ear** to match the row’s intent. Don’t worry about precision.  
3. Once it feels right, quickly sketch the positions in the table, e.g.:

   - `MIX: 10h · TIME: max · FB: 11h · TONE: 9h · TXT: 1h`

4. Give that state a short name in the **TAG** column:
   - “low static horizon”
   - “rotor wash”
   - “acid rain”

Over time, you’ll overwrite the vague descriptors with your own concrete ones.

### 11.3 · Using DiceLoop in a Session

**Ritual**

- Choose a sound source:  
  - □ drone bed   □ drum loop   □ field recording   □ voice   □ other: ________
- Insert DiceLoop where it feels right (inline or on a send).
- Decide: “Is DiceLoop the **main voice** or just **weather** today?”

**Session rules**

1. Start clean. Play the source alone for 30–60 seconds.
2. Roll the die → dial in the row → play for at least 3 minutes.
3. You may:
   - Nudge knobs slightly to keep it alive, **but** the row’s core feeling should stay intact.
4. Once per session you may **reject** a roll.  
   The next roll must be honored.

- After a few sessions, flip through:
  - Which row gave you the most **KEEP? = yes**?
  - Which rows never feel right for this album and want to be rewritten?

Circle the important rows. Cross out or rewrite the useless ones.

### 11.5 · Project-Specific DiceLoop Page

For a specific work (e.g. *I HOPE THE SKY WILL STILL TAKE US*), make a **dedicated variant**:

Fill this by ear during tracking. Let this page become the **DiceLoop chapter** of that record.

✂︎ **TEAR LINE**  
When the album is finished, tear this page out and move it to **PROJECT LOGS** with the record’s other notes.

> It sounded like: __________________________.”

## · SIDEWAYS MODULES (WHY THESE ARE HERE)

This Codex is mostly about systems you can see: tools, courses, instruments, protocols, loops.  
These three modules — **Embodied Knowing**, **Anti-README**, and **Weather Report** — sit at the edges on purpose.

They are here to guard against three quiet failures:

- that the work might forget the body that carries it,  
- that explanation might harden into armor, and  
- that feeling might only be allowed in as “data.”

**Embodied Knowing** asks the studio to start in muscles and routes, not only in notes or commits.  
**Anti-README** preserves a small wild zone where pieces are allowed to exist without being justified.  
**Weather Report** lets mood and pressure be recorded as weather instead of as problems to fix.

None of these pages are mandatory. They are **sideways entrances**.  
Use them when the main doors of planning, documenting, and optimizing feel too tight.

If a future you decides they are no longer needed, they can be torn out, composted, or rewritten into whatever new forms of listening the work requires.

## 12 · EMBODIED KNOWING (OFF-SCREEN PRACTICE)

*Words are not the only way the system speaks. The body keeps logs too.*

### Why this exists
To notice where systems live in muscle, posture, and routes—not only in notes, diagrams, or commits.

To remind you that “understanding” can be a physical event.

### When to use it
- When everything feels over-theorized and under-felt.  
- When you’re making decisions about tools or layout but haven’t listened to your own joints in a while.  
- When you’ve spent more than one full workday in front of a screen.

---

### Practice 1 · Embodied Glitch Walk

*A small walk as a systems audit.*

▢ **Step 1 — Draw the loop.**  
Pick a very familiar micro-route (20–60 seconds at normal pace):  
> desk → doorway → kitchen → sink → back to desk  

Write it here:

> ROUTE: _____________________________________________

▢ **Step 2 — Walk it very slowly, once.**  
- Each time your body has to adapt (step over a cable, twist around a chair, squint at a light, hold your breath near a smell), quietly name a “glitch note” in your head.  
  - “ankle catch”  
  - “neck kink”  
  - “eye sting”  
  - “breath hold”

▢ **Step 3 — Sit down and write only the three you remember.**

1. GLITCH NOTE: ___________________________  
   - Caused by: ___________________________  
   - I could change this by: _______________

2. GLITCH NOTE: ___________________________  
   - Caused by: ___________________________  
   - I could change this by: _______________

3. GLITCH NOTE: ___________________________  
   - Caused by: ___________________________  
   - I could change this by: _______________

**Aftercare**  
Choose *one* tiny physical change this week (move a cable, re-aim a light, shift a chair).  
Leave the others alone for now.

✂︎ **TEAR LINE**  
If there is a glitch you aren’t ready to touch yet, draw a small ✖ next to it and, if it feels right, tear off that corner of the page. Let the gap stand as a reminder that not all repairs must be immediate.

---

### Practice 2 · Body Check Before Build

*A 60-second preflight before you “just start” a session.*

Before opening the laptop or turning on the rig:

▢ What does your back say?  (one word)  
> ___________________

▢ What do your hands say? (one word)  
> ___________________

▢ Where is the tightest point right now? (circle)  
> neck / jaw / chest / gut / hips / knees / other: _______

If one area is shouting, offer it one tiny adjustment before you begin:
- change chair height  
- stretch once  
- stand for the first 10 minutes  

Write down only what you actually changed:

> MICRO-ADJUSTMENT: ____________________________
> EFFECT (if any): ______________________________

*This is not an optimization protocol. It’s a way to remember you have a body before you have a task.*

## 13 · ANTI-README / ANTI-INSTRUCTION

*Sometimes clarity becomes armor. These practices rehearse opacity and trust.*

### Why this exists
To make at least some work that does **not** depend on explanation to be real.

To feel where your instinct to frame, defend, and footnote is helping—and where it is hiding you.

### When to use it
- Once per season, minimum.  
- When you feel the reflex to “contextualize” everything before it can be seen.  
- When a thing feels fragile precisely because you don’t have the words for it yet.

---

### Practice 1 · The Piece Without Notes

▢ **Step 1 — Make something small.**  
Sound, image, object, performance, patch—anything that can exist on its own for at least 30 seconds.

Title (for yourself only, here):

> WORKING TITLE: _______________________________

▢ **Step 2 — Show it to one person with no written text.**  
No wall label, no README, no “this is about…”. If they ask, “What is this?”, you may only respond with:

- “What did you notice?” or  
- “What did it do to you?”

▢ **Step 3 — Afterwards, in the Codex only, write this:**

- Who saw it: ____________________________  
- What they said (exact phrases you remember):  
  > ______________________________________  
  > ______________________________________

- What you *wanted* to say but didn’t:  
  > ______________________________________  

Do not retroactively “fix” the piece with an explanation. Let it sit in your archive with that gap.

---

### Practice 2 · Instruction Fast (24 Hours)

*A short, structured refusal to preface everything.*

▢ **Step 1 — Choose the day.**  
DATE: _______________________________

▢ **Step 2 — For 24 hours, you may not pre-explain ongoing works.**  
- You can still answer direct questions.  
- You cannot volunteer context, caveats, or justifications before someone asks.

When you feel the urge to explain:

▢ **Step 3 — Write the explanation here instead of saying it.**

> WANTED EXPLANATION #1  
> _____________________________________________  
> _____________________________________________  

> WANTED EXPLANATION #2  
> _____________________________________________  
> _____________________________________________  

(Add more as needed.)

At the end of 24 hours, read them back and mark:

- *Needed for care / consent*: underline  
- *Self-protection / anxiety*: circle  

✂︎ **TEAR LINE**  
If there is an explanation you recognize as unnecessary armor, tear it off and move it to COMPOST or destroy it. Note only:

> “On [date] I let one explanation go.”

## 14 · WEATHER REPORT (INNER WEATHER)

*Not everything has to route through critique or productivity. Some things are just weather.*

### Why this exists
To register feeling without immediately converting it into output, improvement, or self-judgment.

To give you a slow, seasonal record of how the work and the rest of life are actually landing in the body.

### When to use it
- Once per week during an active season.  
- After an especially charged session (good or bad).  
- At transitions: start of a project, end of a project, first snow, last day of a class.

---

### Practice 1 · Weekly Weather

Title a page (or section) like this:

> **WEATHER – [SEASON / YEAR]**

Each week, on a chosen day, log three short lines:

**Week of: _________**

- **Sky** (overall):  
  > one word or short phrase for the general mood  
  > e.g., “overcast,” “sharp,” “soft blue,” “static”  

- **Wind** (body voice):  
  > one sentence your body seems to be repeating  
  > “I’m tired.” / “I want more.” / “I don’t want to open the laptop.”  

- **Pressure** (one specific weight):  
  > name a situation, not a feeling  
  > “deadline with no prep,” “house repairs,” “ongoing email thread,” “good obsession with X.”

No analysis. No plan. Just weather.

---

### Practice 2 · System–Weather Crossfade

Use this only when a word or sentence repeats across several weeks.

▢ **Step 1 — Choose the recurring element.**

- Repeating Sky word: ____________________  
- or repeating Wind sentence: ____________________

▢ **Step 2 — Ask two questions:**

1. “Which system in my life is most *amplifying* this?”  
   > _____________________________________  

2. “Which system is *softening* it, even a little?”  
   > _____________________________________  

▢ **Step 3 — Write one small design nudge for each:**

- Turn this knob down by:  
  > (tiny change, not a revolution)  
  > _____________________________________  

- Protect this buffer by:  
  > (boundary, ritual, or support)  
  > _____________________________________  

Treat these as experiments, not verdicts. Revisit in a month and circle anything that actually shifted.

✂︎ **TEAR LINE**  
If an old Weather page feels like a curse instead of a record, you have permission to remove it from the Codex. Note the date and one sentence:

> “On [date], I stopped tracking this storm.”

## [ · PROJECT FIELD BINDING ]

*Where the Codex lands on a single piece of work.*

This module is how a project docks with the rest of the Codex.  
Instead of “remembering to use” the practices, you explicitly wire them into one concrete thing.

- Use one copy of this page **per project**.  
- Keep it in the PROJECT LOGS or INSTRUMENTS tab of the binder.

Circle which logic you want to **lead** this project:

- RAIN / WIND / LONG SHADOW / MIX

Why:

> `___________________________________________________`

Quick translation:

---

#### A.5 · Decay & Remaking Hooks  (ties to §5 · RITUALS OF DECAY & REMAKING)

Pick one scheduled rot point for this project:

> On `_________________ [date/season]` I will:  
> - read this card,  
> - cross out one goal that no longer fits, and  
> - add one sentence to the CONTRADICTION INDEX.

Contradiction you already suspect is hiding in this project:

> _“I am trying to be both `__________` and `__________` in a system that only rewards `__________`.”_

---

#### A.6 · Sideways Modules Hooks  (ties to Embodied / Anti-README / Weather)

- **Embodied Knowing**  
  - One Embodied Glitch Walk I will do *for* this project, specifically:  
    > ROUTE (include project-specific sites, like rack, desk, print table):  
    > `______________________________________________`

- **Anti-README**  
  - One small piece in this project that will be kept **without notes**:  
    > (brief description only for you)  
    > `______________________________________________`

- **Weather Report**  
  - Weeks where I especially want to log Sky / Wind / Pressure for this project:  
    > `start: ________`   `end: ________`

---

#### A.7 · End-of-Project Scan

To be filled in **after** the project reaches some kind of stopping point.

- Soft floor:  
  - Still intact?  □ yes  □ partly  □ no  
  - Short note: `___________________________________`

- One thing this project taught me about my **system** definition:  
  > `_______________________________________________`

- One contradiction that stayed true:  
  > `_______________________________________________`

- One practice from this Codex that was actually useful here:  
  > `_______________________________________________`

- One practice that felt like dead weight:  
  > `_______________________________________________`

✂︎ **TEAR LINE**  
If this project is complete, you may tear this card out and file it with the project’s other artifacts.  
If it is not, but you feel done with this version of it, you may move this card to COMPOST with a one-line obituary:

> “This project card served me until `________`. After that, it started to lie.”

### PROJECT CARD · I HOPE THE SKY WILL STILL TAKE US

**Project name**  
> I HOPE THE SKY WILL STILL TAKE US

**Type**  
> industrial-noise / drone-flight album

**Season / cycle**  
> Winter 2025–26 (tracking), Spring 2026 (mix / release)

---

#### A.1 · Soft Floor + Container

_If this fails, it only breaks:_  
> one album cycle / one winter’s worth of sound sketches

Soft floor:

- People / relationships  
  > family time, core teaching obligations, sleep

- Minimum resources / health / baseline  
  > hearing (no unsafe monitoring), no all-nighters, no debt incurred for gear

---

#### A.2 · What May Be Forgotten

This project does **not** have to:

- be the definitive statement on drones or surveillance  
- be technically perfect in mix/master  
- be accompanied by a full live set or performance

COMPOST condition:

> If by June 1, 2026 this project only produces dread and no signal, I am allowed to move it to COMPOST and keep only two useful textures or methods.

---

#### A.3 · Definitions Under Test

Definition under test:  
> “A glitch is a visible misalignment that reveals how the system actually works.”

How it shows up here:

- System:  
  > the airborne / militarized infrastructure behind the sound palette

- Glitch:  
  > moments where the “beautiful” drone sound cracks and you hear the machinery

- Repair:  
  > structuring tracks so the crack is not smoothed over, but held long enough to be felt

- Joy:  
  > small moments where the sky feels like a commons again, not a threat

---

#### A.4 · Seasonal Logic

Lead logic:  
> LONG SHADOW with RAIN bursts

Rain =  
> fast, dirty recording sessions when a sound idea hits (no overthinking, lots of takes)

Wind =  
> sharing rough mixes with one or two trusted ears, not the internet

Long Shadow decisions might be:  
> how the liner notes frame drones, how the title reads in 10 years, how much you normalize or challenge the aesthetics of “pretty war sound”

---

#### A.5 · Decay & Remaking Hooks

Rot point:

> On the first truly warm day of 2026, I will read this card, cross out one track that no longer feels aligned, and name one contradiction for the CONTRADICTION INDEX.

Suspected contradiction:

> “I am trying to make something sonically gorgeous out of technologies that harm, in a culture that rewards aestheticizing harm.”

---

#### A.6 · Sideways Modules Hooks

Embodied Knowing:

> ROUTE: chair → window → door → outside → look up for 30 seconds → back to chair.  
> (Used when making mix decisions about “altitude” and “distance.”)

Anti-README:

> Piece without notes: one short interlude / field recording track released with no title explanation.

Weather Report:

> Watch Sky/Wind/Pressure logs in the weeks where working on the record makes sleep harder.  
> If “wired” or “numb” shows up three weeks in a row, revisit systems.

---

#### A.7 · End-of-Project Scan

(To be filled later.)

- Soft floor: ____  
- System definition survived? Y / N / Mutated into: _______  
- One Codex practice that mattered: ________  
- One that didn’t: ________

### PROJECT CARD · MN42 (MOARkNOBS-42)

**Project name**  
> MOARkNOBS-42 (MN42) – critical MIDI controller

**Type**  
> instrument / hardware + firmware + documentation

**Season / cycle**  
> Winter–Spring 2025–26 (hardware finalization, enclosure, v1 “stable”)

---

#### A.1 · Soft Floor + Container

_If this fails, it only breaks:_  
> One hardware revision cycle and one branch of firmware.  
> It does **not** get to take down your confidence in teaching or designing instruments.

Soft floor:

- People / relationships  
  > Family time; baseline availability for work and students; no “just one more test” that steals sleep for multiple nights.

- Minimum resources / health / baseline  
  > No dangerous mains hacks; no over-spending on fancy panels you can’t afford; no working with solder fumes or dust without ventilation.

---

#### A.2 · What May Be Forgotten

This project does **not** have to:

- be the final, ultimate controller you ever make  
- ship with every dreamed-of feature or mode  
- be manufacturable at scale or perfectly DFM’d

It may arrive as a **“reference build”** and a story about how you got there.

COMPOST condition:

> If by September 1, 2026 MN42 v1 still consists only of endless rework and guilt with no playable, documented prototype, I am allowed to:  
> - freeze the hardware as-is,  
> - ship only the clearest build notes, and  
> - move “perfect MN42” to COMPOST, keeping only what people actually used.

---

#### A.3 · Definitions Under Test

Definition under test:  
> “A system is a set of constraints and channels that shapes how attention, labor, and play circulate.”

How it shows up here:

- System:  
  > The physical layout + firmware modes + documentation that decide what kinds of play MN42 encourages or suppresses.

- Glitch:  
  > Mispresses, mis-mappings, or edge-case interactions that reveal where the interface is lying about what it can do.

- Repair:  
  > Hardware tweaks, firmware patches, or documentation changes that **listen to those glitches** instead of silencing them.

- Joy:  
  > That moment when someone else “gets it” and bends MN42 to a use you didn’t plan for—but can still trace and audit.

At the end:  
> Did this definition survive contact? Y / N / Mutated into: ____________

---

#### A.4 · Seasonal Logic

Lead logic:  
> LONG SHADOW with WIND

Rain =  
> Fast prototype sprints: cardboard panels, sharpie layouts, quick solder fixes; short firmware experiments to test one interaction at a time.

Wind =  
> Sharing the current build + docs with 1–3 trusted users (students, peers); collecting their actual confusion points and desires.

Long Shadow =  
> Decisions about connector standards, enclosure footprint, and documentation style that will shape how MN42 lives in other people’s studios 3–10 years from now.

---

#### A.5 · Decay & Remaking Hooks

Rot point:

> At the end of the first real-world workshop or class that uses MN42, I will:  
> - cross out one “must-have” feature that nobody touched, and  
> - add one entry to the CONTRADICTION INDEX about what MN42 is doing in practice vs. what I imagined.

Suspected contradiction:

> “I am trying to make MN42 both a **teaching tool** (open, legible, forgiving) and a **serious performance instrument** (robust, tight, ‘finished’) inside constraints that rarely reward both equally.”

---

#### A.6 · Sideways Modules Hooks

Embodied Knowing:

> ROUTE: desk → MN42 build bench → floor where dropped parts accumulate → window → back to bench.  
> Use one Embodied Glitch Walk specifically paying attention to: cable snags, awkward reach, posture while soldering or patching.

Anti-README:

> Piece without notes: one micro-performance or short MN42 “etude” recorded and shared (even just to a tiny audience) **without** the usual explanatory thread about modes, mappings, or concept.

Weather Report:

> Weeks to watch: any time the words “stuck,” “behind,” or “not enough” show up in Sky/Wind/Pressure.  
> If they repeat three weeks in a row while MN42 is front-and-center, ask: which **system** around MN42 is amplifying this—scoping, expectations, time, perfectionism?

---

#### A.7 · End-of-Project Scan

(To be filled at v1 “done for now.”)

- Soft floor:  
  > □ intact  □ partly intact  □ breached  
  > Note: _______________________________________

- One thing MN42 taught me about “system”:  
  > _____________________________________________

- One contradiction that stayed true:  
  > _____________________________________________

- One Codex practice that actually helped (for real):  
  > _____________________________________________

- One that felt like ritual noise:  
  > _____________________________________________

✂︎ **TEAR LINE**  
If MN42 v1 is complete, this card can live with the MN42 build docs.  
If MN42 drifts out of focus, this card can be moved to COMPOST with one line:

> “MN42 v1 taught me: ____________________. The rest can go.”

### PROJECT CARD · HOME PRINTLAB SETUP

**Project name**  
> Home Printlab – installation & upgrade

**Type**  
> space / infrastructure / tool ecosystem

**Season / cycle**  
> Winter–Spring 2025–26 (initial setup), revisited every 6–12 months

---

#### A.1 · Soft Floor + Container

_If this fails, it only breaks:_  
> One iteration of studio organization and a set of “best guesses” about machines and layout.

Soft floor:

- People / relationships  
  > No disappearing fully into cable management for weeks; housemates/partner still have functional shared spaces.

- Minimum resources / health / baseline  
  > No unsafe power draws; no untested extension daisy chains; no over-spending on furniture or storage that jeopardizes actual life needs.

---

#### A.2 · What May Be Forgotten

This project does **not** have to:

- produce a “perfect” Instagram-ready workshop  
- support every possible machine or material from day one  
- be fully automated or networked like a commercial print farm

It may remain **idiosyncratic and patched**, so long as it is safe and usable.

COMPOST condition:

> If by December 2026 the lab still feels like a permanent construction site that drains energy more than it supports work, I am allowed to:  
> - freeze the setup at “good enough,”  
> - document only what actually works, and  
> - move the dream of the “ideal lab” to COMPOST.

#### A.3 · Definitions Under Test

Definition under test:  
> “Repair is any change that increases livability for the people and tools actually in the room.”

How it shows up here:

- System:  
  > The arrangement of tables, power, machines, storage, and documentation that decides how easy or hard it is to start and finish a print.

- Glitch:  
  > Tripping over cords, hunting for tools, printers that are technically online but psychologically “too annoying” to use.

- Repair:  
  > Small layout shifts, labels, print guides, and habits that reduce friction and make the lab feel welcoming, not scolding.

- Joy:  
  > Walking in, turning on one machine, and getting from idea → slice → print without feeling like you have to re-invent the room every time.

#### A.4 · Seasonal Logic

Lead logic:  
> WIND with LONG SHADOW underneath

Rain =  
> Short, intense bursts of rearranging, rewiring, or upgrading one subsystem at a time (e.g., “today is only about the LulzBot corner”).

Wind =  
> The circulation of objects and people through the space—how students, friends, or future collaborators move through the lab, find what they need, or get stuck.

Long Shadow =  
> Choices about what gets permanently mounted, labeled, or documented—things that will structure your habits and teaching for years.

#### A.5 · Decay & Remaking Hooks

Rot point:

> At the end of the first full season of use (after at least 10 real prints), I will:  
> - walk through with fresh eyes,  
> - cross out one “aspirational” feature (e.g. a planned station) that never got used,  
> - and name one entry for the CONTRADICTION INDEX.

Suspected contradiction:

> “I am trying to make the lab both maximally flexible (reconfigurable, open to new projects) and maximally stable (always ready, always tidy) within a small, real, imperfect house.”

#### A.6 · Sideways Modules Hooks

Embodied Knowing:

> ROUTE: front door → printlab threshold → main work table → each machine in turn → trash/recycling → exit.  
> Use Embodied Glitch Walk to notice: tight squeezes, bad lighting, ventilation, where your back complains.

Anti-README:

> Piece without notes: a single printed object, sign, or small zine that just appears in the lab with no explanatory label—meant only for those who handle it and infer.

Weather Report:

> Pay special attention to Sky/Wind/Pressure entries tagged with “lab,” “mess,” or “overwhelmed.”  
> If “cluttered” or “stuck” shows up repeatedly, map that feeling onto **specific systems** (tool storage, cable routing, label clarity) rather than treating it as a personal failing.

#### A.7 · End-of-Project Scan

(After a defined “phase 1 complete”—e.g., all core machines installed and at least one documented workflow tested.)

- Soft floor:  
  > □ intact  □ partly intact  □ breached  
  > Note: _______________________________________

- One thing the lab taught me about “repair”:  
  > _____________________________________________

- One contradiction that stayed present:  
  > _____________________________________________

- One Codex practice that truly helped the space take shape:  
  > _____________________________________________

- One that never quite landed here:  
  > _____________________________________________

✂︎ **TEAR LINE**  
If this phase of the lab is complete, file this card with photos, diagrams, and the repo notes.  
If the lab keeps changing faster than the card, you may move this version to COMPOST and start a new one titled:

> “PRINTLAB – v2 FIELD BINDING (started on: __________).”
